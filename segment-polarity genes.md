**Segment polarity genes** are a class of zygotic genes that play a crucial role in the precise patterning of individual segments and the stabilization of segment boundaries in the _Drosophila melanogaster_ embryo. They represent the fourth class in the hierarchical genetic control of anteroposterior (A-P) axis patterning, following maternal-effect, gap, and pair-rule genes

.

Here's a detailed description of segment polarity genes:

• **Function and Mutant Phenotypes**

    ◦ Segment polarity genes affect **patterning within each segment** and are essential for establishing the definitive segmental organization of the embryo and larva

.

    ◦ Mutations in these genes lead to characteristic phenotypes with **defects in segment polarity and number**, often resulting in the loss of parts of each segment

. For instance, a mutation in _wingless_ can lead to the loss of a parasegment boundary and conversion of the entire segment into an "anterior" type, also affecting the pattern of denticles

.

• **Expression Pattern**

    ◦ Segment polarity genes are expressed in **14 distinct transverse stripes** across the embryo, with one stripe corresponding to each of the 14 future body segments

.

    ◦ Their expression domains are highly refined, becoming **narrow stripes of one to two cells wide**, which is a more precise pattern than the broader regions of gap genes or the wider stripes of pair-rule genes

.

    ◦ The activity of genes like _engrailed_ first appears as a series of 14 transverse stripes at the time of blastoderm cellularization

.

• **Nature of Gene Products**

    ◦ Unlike gap and pair-rule genes, which exclusively encode transcription factors, segment polarity genes are a **diverse group** that encode various types of proteins

.

    ◦ Their products include:

        ▪ **Transcription factors**: Such as **Engrailed** (_en_)

.

        ▪ **Secreted signaling proteins (ligands)**: Such as **Wingless** (_wg_) and **Hedgehog** (_hh_)

.

        ▪ **Transmembrane receptors**: Such as **Patched** (_ptc_), which is the receptor for Hedgehog

.

    ◦ This diversity allows for **intercellular communication**, which is critical as these genes act in a cellularized environment, unlike the earlier syncytium

.

• **Regulation and Interactions**

    ◦ **Activation by Pair-Rule Genes**: Segment polarity genes are **activated in response to the expression of earlier-acting pair-rule genes**

. This conversion transforms the aperiodic pattern of gap genes and the double-segment periodicity of pair-rule genes into a precise, repeating segmental pattern

.

    ◦ **Stabilization of Parasegment Boundaries**: A key function involves an **intercellular signaling circuit** that establishes and stabilizes the boundaries of parasegments

. This circuit primarily involves the _engrailed_, _hedgehog_, and _wingless_ genes:

        ▪ Cells expressing **Engrailed** also express **Hedgehog** and secrete the Hedgehog signaling protein

.

        ▪ Hedgehog acts on adjacent cells, activating and maintaining the expression of the **Wingless** gene

.

        ▪ The secreted **Wingless protein** then signals back to the _engrailed_-expressing cells, **maintaining the expression of both** **engrailed** **and** **hedgehog**

.

        ▪ This positive feedback loop stabilizes the parasegment boundary and establishes it as a **signaling center**

.

    ◦ **Compartment Identity**: The anterior boundary of each parasegment, delineated by _engrailed_ expression, also functions as a **cell-lineage restriction boundary**, forming distinct developmental compartments

. **Engrailed** is considered a **selector gene** because its continuous expression throughout the fly's life is required to maintain the identity of the posterior compartment of each segment

.

    ◦ **Denticle Patterning**: The signals from Wingless and Hedgehog are crucial for patterning the ventral denticle belts on the larval cuticle. **Wingless represses genes required for denticle formation**, thereby specifying regions of smooth cuticle, while **Hedgehog contributes to patterning the anterior region of the next segment**

.

    ◦ **Interactions with Hox Genes**: Segment polarity genes also interact with other patterning genes. For example, proteins like Sloppy-paired and Engrailed, along with Hox proteins (e.g., Ultrabithorax), bind to the _cis_-acting regulatory element of the _Distal-less_ gene to repress its expression and thus prevent appendage formation in abdominal segments

.

In essence, if maternal and gap genes lay out the major geographical regions and pair-rule genes draw the parallel "latitude lines" for segments, then segment polarity genes act as the "local architects" within each segment, using signaling and feedback loops to precisely define internal structures and borders, ensuring that each neighborhood (segment) is properly organized.
