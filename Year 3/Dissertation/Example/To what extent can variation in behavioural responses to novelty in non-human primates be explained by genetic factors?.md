### **Summary**

Responses to novelty in non-human primates have wide-reaching implications, from the likelihood to eat a novel food to the latency for an infant to leave its mother in a new environment. These responses often have significant variation. As a factor that is inherited and amenable to selection, an understanding of the genetic contribution to these responses and the extent to which genetic variation explains these factors is key. This dissertation addresses this question, as well as exploring other potential contributors to the novel response: various factors of the environment and interactions between the environment and genetic factors. It also places these findings in the context of neural mechanisms, looking at the role of the dopamine D4 receptor, and impacts on wild populations. It finds that behaviours in response to novelty and personality traits describing these behaviours have moderate heritability, and that the responses to novelty exhibit temporal stability. Both the environment and interactions between the environment and the genotype are found to play a significant role in this response.

### **Introduction**

This dissertation explores the body of evidence explaining the link between genetic factors in non-human primates (NHPs) and variation in behavioural responses to novelty: aiming to determine the extent to which genetic variation explains differences in natural behaviour. To achieve this, this dissertation will draw upon a range of studies, primarily on NHPs, but using other species response to novelty to fill in the gaps where evidence is sparse. This dissertation will look at both the genetic heritability of these novelty response behaviours and a range of other data supporting the genetic contribution to the novelty response phenotype, as well as looking at the range of environmental factors altering the same behaviours.

Furthermore, answering the question requires exploring interactions between genetic factors and the environment. These interactions encompass both genes affecting the environment that an individual is exposed to and the environment affecting the heritability of a behaviour as well as looking at how parental genes indirectly affect the offspring through changing the environment.

The dissertation concludes by correlating genetic diversity to mechanistic outcomes and showing similar impacts in wild populations to populations studied in captivity. It will look at mechanisms which have been elucidated and believed to underpin changes in novelty reactive behaviour. With regards to wild populations, it follows that genetically explained variation in behavioural responses would also be exhibited in wild populations, and I explore whether this assumption is supported by the somewhat limited literature whilst also showing that this a possible area of significant further study. As such, this dissertation shows that the findings regarding the genetic contribution to behaviours in captivity can be used to aid understanding in wild primate populations.

### **A Lack of Clarity in the Literature**

NHPs can exhibit a range of behavioural responses to novelty, ranging from exploratory to fearful behaviours. Frequently they are measured through exposure to a novel situation followed by observation and then scoring, for a range of responses. These behaviours are particularly of interest as they describe responses to a new environmental niche.

The literature is unclear as regarding the divide between behavioural traits and personality, with some papers referring to the divide between behavioural traits and personality grouping them under described personality traits such as boldness or exploration. It seems that a general avoidance of the term personality has come about largely due to the desire to prevent anthropomorphism, however in this use of language leads to some confusion. Personality as considered by psychologists covers a broad array of traits including affective and cognitive dispositions. In animal studies these terms can be broadly considered interchangeable, with the scope of study of personality in animals being less extensive than in their human counterparts. Gosling agrees stating that “Most animal personality studies focus on just a subset of these constructs: behavioural traits.” Therefore work referencing both behavioural traits and personality is used to address the core question of this dissertation. In my view this is a semantic issue and papers addressing personality can provide key insight into behavioural responses. Where possible, I have chosen work where the personality elements are logical contributors to the response to novelty, such as boldness. However, in places I consider it useful to look at the wider range of personality traits to allow the drawing together of avenues of study to answer the question, by looking at common features of all personality traits in NHPs to inform the understanding of personality traits describing the response to novel stimuli. This has also been acknowledged in the area of focus for this dissertation with responses to novel stimuli often described as falling along a ‘shy-bold continuum’ with regards to personality.

### **Genetic Contributions**

Genetic variation is widely studied across species in attempting to describe behavioural variation, and the variation itself is tractable to study. The primary facet of the question about the genetic contribution to the novel response to answer, is whether additive genetic variance contributes in a statistically significant way to novel responses. Another key question is what percentage of variation in behaviours can be described by genetic contributions as opposed to other factors such as the environment. This dissertation also explores cutting-edge avenues of research to further study the genetic contribution to the novel response phenotype.

#### **What is heritability?**

A key definition for the understanding of genetic effects is heritability. Vitzthum (2003) defines heritability as _‘the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is associated with genetic context.’_ Heritability is considered by two different metrics, broad-sense H2 and narrow sense heritability h2. The difference between the two is that broad-sense heritability includes the effects of dominant alleles in an individual, whereas narrow-sense heritability ignores this because the effect of allelic dominance cannot be passed on to the offspring. This variance described by narrow-sense heritability is known as additive variance and is the variance of which is amenable to selection. Frequently studies focus on narrow-sense heritability instead of broad-sense heritability since narrow-sense heritability is useful in predicting the response to selection.

#### **An investigation into the causes of behavioural variation**

One paper explores a range of hypotheses to account for variation in the responses of wild Japanese macaques to novel object and novel food tests. These hypotheses are that personality differences could be accounted for by either additive genetic effects, or an effect of maternal environment as is seen in other traits in Japanese Macaques, or that personality differences are related to other social interactions or belonging to one of two social groups. With all three hypotheses being either solitary or belonging to one of two social groups. Macaques were presented with a novel object, or novel food object (an egg), and their behavioural reaction was recorded. These behaviours were condensed by principal component analysis (PCA). This method seems largely robust, however, as the macaques roam wildly on this island, there are at times confounding factors. The macaques could not be tested in a random order or at random times, as the researchers couldn’t set up the experiments ahead of time, due to the free-roaming nature of this population. However, it is clear that the PCA variables were describing where possible. Three principal components describing variance in response to novel food were retained from the PCA: two components describing variance in response to novel food, explaining 68% of variance in this response, and one describing variance in response to consummatory responses and the caution around novel food related. Although the macaques did not respond statistically consistently to the novel object tests, this component to novel food is positively correlated with the second principal component describing the response to novel food and was consistently related to the novel food test. This is more similar between related individuals, suggesting a genetic component describing the response to novelty. Interestingly, the tendency to approach or consume novel food is more different between members of the same social group, and the paper posits this is to allow niche exploitation. Maternal influence was not shown to be a significant driving factor.

#### **Heritability estimates**

Many papers have attempted to estimate the heritability of responses to novelty. In order to understand the proportion of variance described by variation in the genotype. One such paper looked at a group of infant Rhesus Macaques, estimating the heritability of a range of behavioural traits, in response to two different tests. In the first test, infants are placed into an unfamiliar room (acting as a play space) with the mother present but sedated. The behaviours are recorded where behaviours were scored. The second test was a human intruder test, where a one-way window in response to an unknown human intruder. It was found in the infants that some individual behaviours are heritable. In particular the latency to leave the mother in the first test was significantly heritable with an h2=0.254+/−0.147. This is a particularly relevant test for our question, providing insight into the heritability of exploration (or fear) of novelty. The variable for break from mother, a transformation of the latency to leave the mother into a binary leave/stayed outcome, was also significantly heritable with h2=0.376+/−0.204, in addition to the heritability of the moving movement h2=0.304+/−0.153. This provides strong evidence that traits related to novel experiences are influenced by genetic effects. However, the environment can impact these heritability estimates; genetic effects can play a large role in the environment that an individual is exposed to, through altering behaviours governing migration, dispersal, etc. In a different environment, it is possible that a somewhat different heritability estimate would be obtained.

Another important paper for this question looked at the variation in behaviours in response to novel stimuli in personality describing the variation in behaviour. The first two factors characterised to boldness showed significant heritability, with the two factors also showing significant heritability of h2=0.53 and h2=0.33 respectively which was higher than most individual behaviours. This study also showed that aggressive behaviour towards a test and experimental home cage (the normal living environment of NHPs, as opposed to a separate experimental cage). Ten baboons that showed extreme phenotypes of low aggression to the novel object, an attempt was also made to link the range of phenotypes to a candidate gene, SNAP25, with SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in this region explaining a modest (0.5-3%) amount of the variance in the phenotypes. SNAP25 plays a role in exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, however no causative effect has yet been shown.

These heritability estimates can be compared with a meta-analysis of research on personality traits and single behaviours in NHPs. Von Borell et Al (2019) found that the mean narrow sense heritability for both was h2=0.25. In contrast, the heritability of responses to novelty may be among the highest of traits. Whilst the personality traits, describing values in individual behaviours fall largely between 0.25 and 0.40. In the papers discussed, values for behaviours in response to novelty fall at a somewhat higher level of heritability, greater than 0.5 in some cases. A further meta-analysis would be needed to investigate whether this difference is statistically significant but without this, the conclusion that h2>=0.25 is reasonable.

### **Inter and intra-species differences**

One area where it seems clear that genetic differences affect personality and responses to novelty is when looking at inter-species differences. Two closely related NHP species, exposed to the same environment may behave in different ways. These differences in behaviour become significantly more profound as species become less related, for example in birds and primates in the same habitat express vastly different phenotypes including in behavioural variation, and this provides some evidence reinforcing the idea that genetic differences underly intra-species behavioural differences. However it is difficult to identify whether these behavioural differences are due to a genetic difference or that the same differences in the physical phenotype change the interaction with the environment such that the same behavioural mechanisms are expressed differentially.

Rogers attempts to answer this question in a review from 2018, looking largely at “identify[ing] the specific genes and genetic variants that will drive individual differences within a specific or closely related clade of species.” This dissertation will return to the specific mechanisms later on. Rogers’ review shows a clear gap in the literature with regards to novelty-seeking mechanisms. All of the studies noted in this dissertation by Rogers, especially regarding quantitative genetics. These studies are constrained by interbreeding, with this methodology, study of behavioural variation is significantly less tractable. However, this neglects the potential of studying species of both populations. This would allow for investigation of phenotypic differences between similar descent and elucidating for investigation of mechanisms, as opposed to other genetic differences tied directly to personality and neurobiology, as opposed to other genetic differences which may describe other elements of the differing phenotype.

This approach has not yet seen widespread use due to the requirement for significant genome screening. These techniques have been prohibitively expensive until recently, especially for a large group (as acknowledged by Rogers), and so there may be some expansion in this direction over the next decade. One study so far has used this proposed method of looking directly at intra-species differences in a niche scenario, looking at a hybrid zone between Anubis (also known as Olive) and Hamadryas Baboons, for which the differences between these species are quantitative genetic techniques to be used. The social differences between these species are distinct, in particular around divergent mating patterns. Looking at the differences in genes it became clear that a large proportion of the variants centred around the dopaminergic system, and so this was then hypothesized to be underlying the substantial differences in behaviour. This shows the merits of this type of study design, which could be an avenue for breakthrough future study.

### **Temporal stability of behavioural responses to novelty**

Another important factor concerning the genetic contribution to the novel response is whether significant variation would suggest that these behaviours are formed by genetic factors; responses being stable does not show they are significantly formed by genetic factors. Whilst responses being stable does not suggest they are significantly formed by genetic factors. This characterisation to look at the expressed level of behaviour, it is useful for this characterisation to look at the expressed level of a trait relative to an animal’s peers. This is referred to as rank-order, and rank-order change is a metric which can be measured. The other metric related to this idea of mean level change: a change in the absolute level of a trait. Populations may stay ordered with regards to rank-order, but have a mean-level regression. These changes are often plotted against age, as the NHP responses to novelty into adulthood stabilises. For many traits there is a regression in the mean-level between individuals stabilises. Further to this, Von Borell et Al 2019, finding that rank-order of the expressions of age. For many traits there is a regression in the mean-level expressed with age. For many traits there is a regression in the mean-level with age. Further to this, Von Borell et Al 2019, finding that rank-order of the expressions of age.

### **Environmental Factors**

As well as genetic contributions to differences in the response to novelty, other key factors also provide an estimate for the environmental variance for a trait, provided by the remaining variance not described by additive genetic variance. Much as in humans, the environment of an individual’s upbringing may shape its personality and therefore behaviours, or the current environment may modulate the response.

#### **Social effects**

The environment can lead to both short term or long-term effects on behaviour, modulating both short term responses and having a longer-term effect through ‘learnings’. One way in which the environment can have an effect is through the social environment and group dynamics. As seen earlier, Arnaud et Al found that individual Rhesus Macaques adopt different strategies regarding their response to novelty. In this case the social environment modulates the response. Furthermore they showed an effect of the social rank on the response to a novel object, with higher ranking females being less explorative, confirming the influence of social rank on the strategy chosen in response to novelty. Further studies aiming to identify whether these effects are learnt or context-dependent.

The above hypothesis on the persistence of behavioural changes can be partially approximated by looking at naturally occurring events, to investigate if a change in social environment leads to a change in behaviour. The first dispersal of male Rhesus Macaques is one of the factors investigated by a paper by Von Borell et Al from 2016, which followed the behaviours of a free-ranging primate research group. Following dispersal, the male aggression, which affected a wide range of individual’s behaviours. It should be noted that the methodology used in this paper has its drawbacks, primarily that it is impossible to separate these changes from the developmental changes which lead to the dispersal event. To determine if these behavioural changes were solely due to the change in environment, the environment would need to be changed for a large group of primates at random times during their lifespan.

This paper also shows that the birth of the first infant for Rhesus Macaques has an effect on behaviours exhibited, with new mothers decreasing the number of new social interactions made outside of maternal kin. Furthermore, resting behaviour was significantly increased, which would be expected to correlate to a decrease in novelty seeking although this is not explored directly in the paper. The rest of the personality traits investigated remain broadly the same.

Additionally, fear of novelty can influence the behaviours which an individual carries out. Neophobia (fear of novelty) is overcome more quickly when in a group setting than when individuals are alone in a range of non-human primate species. These results were obtained from captive NHP social facilitations, however the results have been experimentally verified in wild hyenas. This social facilitation response can be exhibited simply where an increased number of individuals in the social group will decrease the latency to eat the same food source.

#### **Stress**

As well as the social environment, environmental stress in infancy or prenatally has long-term effects on the behavioural phenotype, due to differences in the prenatal stress on the serotonin transporter. Similarly, there is evidence that observation of a new caregiver being eaten by another individual in a more complex way is that observation of a new food being eaten by another individual when presented with a novel object. Neglectful early care manifests in increased fearfulness when presented with a novel object.

### **Age-related changes**

Whilst not a direct feature of the environment, the age of an individual plays an important role in determining the response to novelty, in so much as it is a passive process that does not differ between environments, the age of an individual plays an important role in determining the response to novelty, and in so much as it is a passive process that does not differ between environments, the age of an individual plays an important role in determining the response to novelty, and in so much as it is a passive process that does not differ between environments, the age of an individual plays an important role in determining the response to novelty, and in so much as it is a passive process that does not differ between environments, the age of an individual plays an important role in determining the response to novelty, and in so much as it is a passive process that does not differ between environments, the age of an individual plays an important role in determining the response to novelty. A paper by Massen et Al looked at both boldness and exploration tendency, and the effects of age on these traits. These traits are clearly defined by Massen, describes boldness as ‘a non-fearful response to a threat’ and exploration tendency as ‘an animal understands the two definitions of boldness. I continue to use these definitions here. Clearly exploration tendency fits the question, describing responses to novel stimuli, however depending on how an animal understands the two definitions of boldness then boldness also plays an important role in describing these behaviours. Three different types of test were carried out by Massen et Al on two groups of Chimpanzees, with more than one specific test within each category: a predator model, novel objects/food, and puzzles. The groups were exposed to these tests twice, with a variable number of months between the two test dates, allowing consistency of results to be measured. Repeatability is seen as an important marker of personality. PCA was carried out on these results, producing two components, between which 70% of the variation was explained. These components mapped to exploration-persistence (51.6% of variance) and boldness (19.3% of variance). The key result of this experiment is that both of those components showed a negative linear correlation when mapped to age. Therefore as age increased, the chimpanzees were less bold and less open to exploration suggesting that age is negatively correlated with novelty seeking behaviours.

This has been replicated in other non-human primate species, to they named koski et Al studied Marmosets in 2017 and found that for a personality trait they named inquisitiveness there was a negative correlation with age, similar to the results in chimpanzees. Manson and Perry in 2013 looked at Capuchin Monkeys, in their case the factor describing traits related to the response to novel stimuli, was termed openness, and this was also found to be significantly, negatively correlated with age. A paper on If the Orangutans found a strong convincing of age impacting novelty seeking behaviours, however it does provide strong evidence of age affecting novelty behaviours more generally, by itself this is not particularly convincing of age affecting novelty seeking behaviours, however it does provide strong evidence of age impacting novelty seeking behaviours more generally. By itself this is not particularly neophilia in a range of NHPs.

Age has a further effect on the response to novelty by reducing the level of behavioural plasticity expressed. This could describe the effects of age seen thus far. Behavioural plasticity describes the ability of one genotype to generate multiple behavioural phenotypes, typically in response to different environmental conditions. By itself this is not particularly convincing. By itself this is not particularly convincing. By itself this is not particularly convincing of age affecting novelty seeking behaviours, however it does provide strong evidence of age impacting novelty seeking behaviours more generally.

### **Interactions Between Genes and the Environment**

Interactions between genes and the environment with regards to behaviour are described in papers by Kendler and Eaves from 1986. Today, the interactions between genes and the environment are considered intertwined, with genes and the environment both exerting an effect on the other. These interactions are broadly categorised into GxE (gene x environment) interactions and rGE (gene environment correlations). In a more recent paper GxE was characterised as ‘a genetic sensitivity to the environment’. Put differently, GxE explains situations where the effects of genes are different in and not independent of each other. Separately to GxE, rGE are defined as ‘a genetic factor is that influencing an individual’s exposure to particular environments’. A pertinent example is that individuals who exhibit a heritable phenotype for exploring novelty are therefore more likely to be in and exposed to unfamiliar environments. Beyond these definitions, parental genes may have indirect effects on the offspring via contributions to the infant’s environment, and these will also be considered.

#### **Age and heritability**

As well as functioning similarly to an environmental factor, age can also have a significant impact on the genetic contribution to a behaviour. Heritability in NHPs for personality is likely to decrease with age, with a study in humans showing heritability starting at about 75% during infancy and dropping to 35-40% in later adulthood. However, a lack of studies in NHPs. A study following this template should be carried out to investigate this effect in NHPs.

#### **GxE effects**

One study providing insight into GxE interactions was carried out on a variety of chimpanzees in 2015. The study by Latzman et Al looked at two different groups of chimpanzees. One group had been reared by their mothers (the other group had been removed from their mothers for various failures of care and either unresponsive care, or the mother being injured or wild-born) and reared in a large nursery by humans. A third group was considered, of un-reared chimpanzees however they were significantly older than the other groups so were discounted. This study found that chimpanzees reared in the nursery had some evidence that a change in environment changed the genetic control: providing lower heritability of a personality trait than those reared with their mothers: providing bias in the experimental results as there might be a genetic factor causing mothers to provide worse care to the offspring which is therefore overrepresented in the nursery group. Further testing could eliminate this source of bias and confirm these results.

Furthermore, a stressful upbringing was also found to have an impact through GxE interactions, as well as via its direct environmental effects. Fairbanks et Al took advantage of the Vervet Research Colony (VRC) being moved across country to conduct an increased stress levels during the move and their response to novelty. This previously contributed to an increase in hair cortisol in both locations, the new home contributed to increased stress levels. Further discussion of the increased stress levels due to the environment were more resilient to a change in behaviour, exhibiting a higher level of novelty seeking behaviour in the new environment than those individuals which were exhibiting adults of a difference in the plasticity of the novelty seeking behaviour could be comparative of adults or that juveniles in the new environment were more resilient to a change in behaviour, exhibiting a higher level of novelty seeking behaviour could in either be indicative of a difference in the plasticity of the novelty seeking behaviour in juveniles compared to adults or that the juvenile animals react to the stressful conditions differently, either through baseline cortisol levels falling quickly, or the animals becoming used to a new baseline cortisol level. Further study could help to elucidate this area.

#### **Parental effects**

Another mechanism by which genetics can indirectly affect an individual is through genetically, primarily maternally for most non-human primate species, can change the delivered, primarily maternally for most non-human primate species, can change the exposure to stress or otherwise alter the environment for the offspring. As shown, genetic factors contribute significantly to NHP personality and behaviours, including the quality of caregiving provided. As such, parental genetics, even alleles not inherited by the offspring, also exert an indirect influence on the offspring.

---

### **Mechanisms**

It is also of interest to consider the mechanisms by which genetic factors influence behaviour. What mutations lead to the heritable behaviours in response to novelty so far? This is a hard question to explore generally, and neuroscience can be taken from its infancy. However, there are some studies available, as learning in animals is in its human studies to inform on likely mechanisms for NHPs.

Rogers also offers some insight on one of the key issues behind mechanistic studies - determining the number of loci required to underlie a phenotypic change. Drawing from studies in humans it is clear that height depends on thousands of genes. In contrast to this, other significant phenotypes of significance are described by single genes. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by a single mutation in the CFTR gene (an ion transporter), another way a shift in phenotype can be explained by either simple or complex mechanisms.

#### **The dopamine D4 receptor**

The one study from 2007 in the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene demonstrates that a polymorphism found in human populations is also seen in a non-human primate model. In humans there has been found to be a 48 base pair repeat in the coding region of the gene, between 2 and 8 repeats in length, this also seen in a non-human primate model. Subjects with the longer repeats affecting dopamine binding to the receptor. The analysis was carried out in vervet monkeys with known pedigree, aiming to show that this polymorphism was correlated with novelty seeking by genotyping the group, it was discovered that two alleles were present for the DRD4 gene: a more common variant of 6 repeats in length, and a less common shorter variant which is 5 repeats in length. The 6 repeats variant was in length, and a less common shorter variant which is 5 repeats in length. Homozygous for 5 repeats, all monkeys exhibited either heterozygosity or homozygosity for 6 repeats. Testing of the response to novelty was carried out by placing a novel object in the home cage and an approach by the monkey to within 1m of the object was recorded. It was found that this polymorphism was significant in the response to novelty, making it clear was that dopamine in mediating the response to novelty. Interestingly, the DRD4 is expressed in various brain areas and pituitary with lower expression compared to the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, however it is particularly expressed in to the localisation is similar, to influence this behaviour. Further research is needed to unravel the underlying processes to influence this behaviour. This experiment shows that the underlying mechanism of a gene impacting behaviour can be studied and that evidence of a causal mechanical link can provide key evidence towards a hypothesis. However, as with all neuroscience, elucidating all levels between cellular biochemistry and phenotypic behaviour remains extremely challenging and the many links required to connect cellular function to behaviour each need exploration.

### **Linking Experimental Results to Behaviour in the Wild**

Importantly, up until this point this dissertation has not shown evidence towards behaviours measured in captivity or non-captive experimental conditions being replicated in the wild. It feels somewhat intuitive that there would be consistency of response, however it is a very important underpinning of the importance of this dissertation. If true, then the genetic make-up of individuals and populations is a descriptor for a share of the variance in the level and perhaps could be used in the future as a predictive property on the population level, particularly if personality has an impact on the fitness of an individual. In the case of novelty seeking, understanding the level of genetic contribution in a specific habitat. As may already prediction of behaviours such as the exploitation of a novel habitat. As may already genetics both have direct impact on behaviours and environmental experiences through rGE correlations, so in the wild.

#### **Cross-situational consistency**

Johnson-at-Al’s consistency home et Al tested this hypothesis further in 2008, looking at Rhesus Macaques with a view to providing a link between the responses to novelty of these individuals and their wild behaviours. Kinally and has already been scrutinized, but an element of this study. The methodology of this study is that the personality factors seem to consist of behaviours, is that the personality factors seem to be robust in a range of social behaviours as well, showing cross-situation consistencies. In light of these results, it seems that the responses of these behaviours are specific only to the studies and behaviours studied here, or apply across a range of behaviours and taxa, but to the taxa and behaviours studied here, or apply across a range of behaviours and taxa, but to the taxa and behaviours studied here, or apply across a range of behaviours and are also applicable to the wild.

Furthermore, there is some limited literature directly looking at the effects of genetic variation in wild populations. Trefilov et Al showed in 2000, that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype. This provides further evidence that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype. This provides further evidence that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype. This provides further evidence that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype. This provides further evidence that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype. This provides further evidence that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype. This provides further evidence that the age of dispersal from the group is correlated to the genotype.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this dissertation shows that the additive genetic variance contributes around a quarter to a third of the behavioural response to novelty in NHPs, as shown by narrow-sense heritability. Long-term present, describing for example the effects of neophobia. In contrast, long term increased social facilitation leads to a decrease in neophobia. In contrast, long term environmental factors describe which have long-term effects altering an individual’s behaviour. These can be understood as similar to learnt patterns of behaviour. For example, individuals which had a more stressful upbringing are more neophobic.

In addition to these environmental factors, age can have a significant effect on the behaviours expressed by these NHPs, with novelty seeking behaviour decreasing with age once adolescence is reached. This decrease is observed at a population level and it has been shown to be significant interplay between genetic factors and environmental factors, where for example the stability of the rank-order for behaviours being high in NHPs.

Furthermore, there is significant interplay between genetic factors and environmental factors, where for example the stability of the rank-order for behaviours is high in NHPs.
