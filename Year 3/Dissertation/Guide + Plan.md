# Part II Genetics Dissertation Guide

## üéØ Core Goal & Key Challenge

- **Primary Objective:** Achieve a **First Class (70+)** in the Part II Genetics Tripos.
- **Dissertation Weighting:** **25%** of the final mark.
- **Format:** **6,000-word** literature-based research essay.
- **Key Challenge:** The primary challenge is to transition from descriptive writing (the 2:2 'synopsis' trap) to **critical, interpretative, and analytical argumentation** (the hallmark of a First).

## üèÜ Marking Criteria: Deconstructed

This is the official standard you are being marked against. The key is understanding the jump between each class.

### Very High First (Excellent)
> - **Argumentation:** The dissertation is an original contribution to its field; the argument presented is sophisticated and highly challenging, yet written with clarity and precision; could provide the basis of an article to be submitted to an academic journal.
> - **Research/Presentation:** Shows clear evidence of exhaustive background research undertaken, with critical and analytical assessment of the major contributions; presentation and referencing are immaculate.
> **‚û°Ô∏è Key Takeaway:** This is publishable-level work. It requires a genuinely novel synthesis or perspective. The goal is to aim for a solid First; achieving this level is an exceptional outcome.

### First (Very Good)
> - **Argumentation:** Contains originality of argumentation, an interpretative and considered approach, and demonstrates comprehensive knowledge of the field; very well structured with clear expression and judicious illustration; should be challenging.
> - **Research/Presentation:** Demonstrates extensive use of available research resources; scientific literature handled judiciously and analytically; polished presentation and referencing.
> - **Ideas:** Uniformly original and sophisticated.
> **‚û°Ô∏è Key Takeaway:** This is the target. It's not just a summary, it's **your own interpretation and argument**. The keywords are **originality, interpretation, analytical, and challenging**.

### Upper Second (Good)
> - **Argumentation:** A good, sound argument containing competent discussion of the topic while demonstrating satisfactory overall knowledge of the field; should show clarity and organization with appropriate selection of material.
> - **Research/Presentation:** Competent use has been made of available text books; account is taken of journal articles, although perhaps not uniformly; satisfactory presentation and referencing.
> - **Ideas:** Ideas should show increasing cogency and resourcefulness.
> **‚û°Ô∏è Key Takeaway:** A solid, well-organised essay that presents a clear argument. It's competent, but may lack the deep analytical edge or originality of a First.

### Lower Second (Fair)
> - **Argumentation:** Average level of argumentation containing basic ideas, although generally limited to straightforward narrative treatment (e.g. synopsis); limited knowledge of the field; adequate structure, but often not well developed.
> - **Research/Presentation:** Use of scientific literature is limited... they are not dealt with critically or analytically; presentation and referencing will often have inconsistencies.
> - **Ideas:** Marked tendency towards padding; paucity of own ideas.
> **‚û°Ô∏è Key Takeaway:** This is the "summary" trap. It describes what others have found but doesn't build a strong argument or offer a critical perspective. **This is the level to actively avoid.**

## üìù Official Advice on Dissertation Preparation

### 1. Define Your Topic
- **Focus on a question:** Beware of being too broad. A narrow, focused question is manageable and allows for depth.
- **Example:**
    - **Too broad:** "The role of genes in cancer"
    - **Manageable:** "Is the *xxx* gene implicated in cancer of the lung?"
- Spend significant time refining your question with your supervisor.

### 2. Writing Style & Argument
- **Objective:** Your goal is a **critical assessment** of a restricted topic.
- **Distinguish your voice:** Make it clear to the reader what is established evidence from the literature and what is **your own assessment or interpretation**.
- The final product should be an "extended, balanced, informative **critique**".
- Assess and **weigh** different categories of evidence. Point to **gaps in knowledge** or flaws in the evidence.

### 3. Sources & References
- **Read what you cite.** If you haven't read a paper but saw it cited elsewhere, cite it as "cited in [source where you saw it]".
- **Reference Count:** Aim for **20 to 40 references**. Don't exceed this without good reason and consultation with your supervisor.
- **Use citation tracking:** Use Web of Science to find papers that have cited a key article. This is a powerful way to follow a story's development.

### 4. Originality & Future Research
- **This is a key opportunity to show First-Class thinking.**
- Include a separate section setting out **promising lines of future research**.
- You can frame this section like a research proposal for a grant.
- This is where you can display **real originality and creativity**.

### 5. Proofreading & Editing
- **Prune mercilessly:** Your first draft is not your final draft. Be ruthless in cutting down waffle.
- **Use short sentences.**
- A good critical assessment is a **creative process**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Formatting, Referencing & Literature Retrieval

### Naming Conventions (Nomenclature)
- Use *italics* or underlining for Latin genus and species names (e.g., *Agrostis canina*).
- Abbreviate the genus after first use if unambiguous (e.g., *A. tenuis*).
- The Latin name should accompany the first mention of a vernacular (common) name.

### Figures and Tables
- Can be copied from papers or compiled yourself.
- Each must be **numbered** (e.g., Figure 1, Table 2).
- Each must have a **caption**.
- Each must be **referred to in the text** (e.g., "as shown in Figure 1...").

### Referencing and Citation Style
- **In-text:**
    - Smith (1992) or (Smith 1992)
    - Three or more authors: (Smith et al. 1992)
    - Multiple references: (Smith 1992; White 1971)
- **Reference List:**
    - **Order:** Alphabetical by first author, then by date.
    - **Journal Article:** Smith, A., Black, B. & White, E.J. (1967). The ecology of natural communities. *Journal of Ecology*, **42**, 460-53.
    - **Book:** Smith, A. (1976). *Mountains and Moorlands*. Collins, London.
- **Consistency is key.**
- **CRITICAL:** Always **consult your specific Department's guidelines** for any variations.

### Literature Retrieval Strategies
- **Starting Points:**
    - Textbooks (but be aware they are often out of date).
    - Review series: *'Trends in...', 'Annual Review of...', 'Progress in...'* are invaluable.
- **Core Databases:**
    - **ISI Web of Science** (available via Cambridge)
    - Biological Abstracts
    - Science Citation Index
- **Keeping Up-to-Date:**
    - Alerting systems like *Current Contents*.
    - The Internet for researchers' interests and research in progress.
