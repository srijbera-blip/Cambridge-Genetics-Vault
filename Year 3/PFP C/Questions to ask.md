- What services they provide.
    
- How they are funded.
    
- How they work with local GPs or hospitals.


**A) Start with rapport and an open question:**

- "Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm here to learn a bit more about people's experiences."
    
- "To start, could you tell me a little bit about how you first got involved with Madlani Cancer Support?" (This is a great, gentle opening question).
    

**B) Explore their experience (The "Illness" perspective):**

These questions are directly from your assignment brief.

- "What have been your main concerns since your diagnosis?"
    
- "What has the impact been on your day-to-day life?"
    
- "What sort of help have you found you need, whether that's from family, friends, or services like this one?"
    

**C) Explore their experience with healthcare:**

- "How has your experience been with the healthcare system, for example with your GP or at the hospital?"
    
- "What do you think are the strengths of the support you've received?"
    
- "Is there anything you feel could have been done differently or better?"
    

**D) Explore their experience with the charity:**

- "How does this organisation help you specifically?"
    
- "What are the best things about the support you get here?"
    

**Crucial tips to avoid causing distress:**

- **Ask for permission:** "Would you be comfortable talking a little bit about...?"
    
- **Use gentle language:** Instead of "How bad is it?", try "What has that been like for you?"
    
- **Never interrupt.** Let them finish their thoughts, even if there are long pauses. Silence is okay.
    
- **Listen more than you talk.** Your job is to understand, not to solve their problems.
    
- **It's okay to say:** "That sounds incredibly difficult." Acknowledging their feelings (empathy) is a key clinical skill.
    
- **If they get upset,** pause and say, "I'm so sorry, this is clearly a difficult thing to talk about. We can stop, or we can talk about something else if you'd prefer."
