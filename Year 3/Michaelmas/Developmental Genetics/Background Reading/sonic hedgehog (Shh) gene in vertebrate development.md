The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene is a crucial "toolkit gene" in vertebrate development, playing multiple, context-dependent roles in the formation and patterning of various tissues. It is a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila hedgehog gene and encodes a secreted signaling protein

Multiple roles of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene in Vertebrate development:
- limb development: Shh is expressed in the posterior part of the developing limb bud, known as the zone of polarising activity (ZPA), in various vertebrates including chicks, mice, humans and fish. It acts as a [[Pattern formation, morphogen gradients (e.g., Bicoid), and the function of Hox genes.|morphogen]] that patterns the antero-posterior axis of the limb, dictating the identity and number of digits
- transplantation of ZPA or ectopic expression of Shh in the anterior limb bud can induce extra digits with reversed polarity (e.g. mirror image duplication of digits)
- the pattern of digits is concentration-dependent on Shh
- loss of Shh function in mice leads to truncated limbs, with no digits in the forelimb and a single digit in the hindlimb
- mutations in the [[Cis-acting elements|cis-acting regulatory element]] ([[ZRS]]) controlling Shh expression in the limb bud can cause polydactyly (extra anterior digits) in humans and cats
- Shh signaling also helps maintain Fgf gene expression in the apical ectodermal ridge, linking different axes of limb development. It influences limb muscle diversity and apical [[ectodermal ridge degeneration]]
- in snakes, loss of hindlimbs is linked to changes in [[ZRS]], resulting in transitory Shh expression and apical [[ectodermal ridge]] degeneration
