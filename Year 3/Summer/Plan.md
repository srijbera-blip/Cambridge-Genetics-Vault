# Your Genetics Prep Plan (July - September 2025)

## The Weekly Rhythm

- **Mon-Tue:** Focus on **Conceptual Understanding**. Read core textbook chapters and create summary notes in NotebookLM.
- **Wed:** Engage with **Primary Literature**. Find and analyse a key review article on the week's topic.
- **Thu:** Build **Essay Skills**. Formulate a relevant essay question and write a detailed bullet-point plan.
- **Fri:** **Consolidate**. Create a one-page mind map or summary of the week's topic.
- **Weekend:** **Rest.** This is mandatory to ensure you start the term energized.

## Phase 1: Molecular & Developmental Foundations

### Week 1 (July 23 - July 27): Getting Started
- [x] **Module:** Genes, Genomes & Chromosomes
- [x] **Focus:** Finalise your setup and understand the basics of chromatin.
- [x] **Activity:** Complete the current task: use Griffiths Ch. 12 & 14 to answer the four questions on chromatin and histones in NotebookLM.

### Week 2 (July 28 - Aug 3): Eukaryotic Gene Control
- [x] **Module:** Genes, Genomes & Chromosomes
- [x] **Focus:** Mechanisms of [[Basics - regulation of transcription in eukaryotes and genome and genomics|transcriptional control ]](transcription factors, enhancers, promoters, chromatin remodelling).
- [x] **Activity:** Plan an essay for the title: "Discuss the diverse mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells achieve precise transcriptional control."

### Week 3 (Aug 4 - 10): The Non-Coding Genome
- [x] **Module:** Genes, Genomes & Chromosomes
- [x] Go through last year cell and developmental biology lectures
- [x] **Focus:** The function and significance of [[non-coding RNAs]] (e.g., lncRNAs, miRNAs) and the broader implications of the ENCODE project.
- [x] **Activity:** Write a plan for the essay: "‘[[Junk DNA]]’ is a defunct concept. Discuss."

### Week 4 (Aug 11 - 17): Building the Body Plan
- [ ] **Module:** Developmental Genetics
- [ ] **Focus:** [[Pattern formation, morphogen gradients (e.g., Bicoid), and the function of Hox genes.]]
- [ ] **Activity:** Find and analyse a review article on the discovery and function of the Hox gene cluster.

### Week 5 (Aug 18 - 24): Cell Fate and Plasticity
- [ ] **Module:** Developmental Genetics
- [ ] **Focus:** [[Determination of cell fate, stem cells (embryonic and adult), and induced pluripotency (iPSCs).]]
- [ ] **Activity:** Plan an essay for the title: "Compare and contrast the mechanisms and applications of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells."

### Week 6 (Aug 25 - 31): The Evolution of Development (Evo-Devo)
- [ ] **Module:** Developmental Genetics
- [ ] **Focus:** How changes in developmental genes can lead to major evolutionary changes in body form.
- [ ] **Activity:** Analyse a classic Evo-Devo case study (e.g., beak evolution in Darwin's finches, or limb loss in snakes).

## Phase 2: Population & Evolutionary Dynamics

### Week 7 (Sep 1 - 7): The Engines of Evolution
- [ ] **Module:** Evolutionary Genetics
- [ ] **Focus:** Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In-depth understanding of natural selection vs. genetic drift.
- [ ] **Activity:** Plan an essay for the title: "‘Genetic drift is a more significant evolutionary force than natural selection.’ Discuss this statement."

### Week 8 (Sep 8 - 14): Reading the Tree of Life
- [ ] **Module:** Evolutionary Genetics
- [ ] **Focus:** Molecular evolution (neutral theory, molecular clocks) and the principles of phylogenetics.
- [ ] **Activity:** Analyse a review article on how DNA sequencing has revolutionised our understanding of human evolution.

### Week 9 (Sep 15 - 21): The Genetics of Complex Traits
- [ ] **Module:** Quantitative & Population Genetics
- [ ] **Focus:** Polygenic inheritance, heritability ($H^2$ vs $h^2$), and the principles behind Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
- [ ] **Activity:** Plan an essay: "What have GWAS studies taught us about the genetic architecture of common human diseases, and what are their limitations?"

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Final Preparation

### Week 10 (Sep 22 - 28): The Synoptic View
- [ ] **Focus:** Connecting ideas across all four modules. This is the key skill for Paper 3.
- [ ] **Activity:** Review all your weekly mind maps. Formulate and plan three "synoptic" essay questions that link at least two modules.
	- [ ] **Example 1:** "How has our understanding of genome architecture informed our interpretation of evolutionary processes?"
	- [ ] **Example 2:** "Discuss how mutations in developmental control genes can lead to both disease and evolutionary novelty."
	- [ ] **Example 3:** *Create your own synoptic question linking Quantitative Genetics and Developmental Genetics.*
