## A. Detailed Study Guide

### I. General Properties and Functions of the Cytoskeleton

- **Definition and Core Functions:System of protein filaments in all eukaryotic cells.
- Maintains cell shape, facilitates locomotion, and organizes intracellular trafficking.
- Enables processes like cell migration, cancer cell spread, sperm swimming, and muscle contraction.
- Crucial for mitotic and meiotic divisions (chromosome segregation, contractile ring).
- Involved in organelle partitioning, cell polarity, and asymmetric positioning of cell determinants.
- **Fundamental Features:Polymer Formation:** Based on distinct monomers assembling into filaments.
- **Dynamic Nature:** Highly dynamic, undergoing continuous turnover modulated by accessory proteins. Subunits diffuse and reorganize rapidly in response to cues.
- **Subunit Composition:** Built from small, diffusible subunits held together mainly by noncovalent interactions.
- **Accessory Proteins:** Modulate spatial distribution, dynamic behavior, and provide interfaces with signaling pathways.
- **Rapid Remodeling:** Can undergo abrupt and extensive reorganization.

### II. Basic Cytoskeletal Polymers

- **Intermediate Filaments (IFs):**
- **Structure:** Rope-like fibers (~10 nm diameter). Heterogeneous family of proteins with globular ends and a central alpha-helical rod forming coiled-coil dimers. Dimers arrange into antiparallel, staggered, non-polar tetramers (soluble subunits).
- **Assembly:** Bundled by self-association or accessory proteins (filaggrin, plectin).
- **Function:** Provide mechanical strength to cells and tissues (e.g., skin, muscle, neurons). Critical for axonal organization.
- **Examples:Keratins:** Diverse, tissue-specific (epithelia, nails, hair, feathers). Anchor to [[desmosomes]]. Mutations cause [[epidermolysis bullosa simplex]].
- **Vimentin-like:** Vimentin (fibroblasts), desmin (smooth muscle). Form cellular meshwork.

- **Critical Concentration (Cc):** Concentration of free monomers where subunit addition/loss is balanced. Cc(+) < Cc(-).
- **ATP Cycle and Dynamics:** ATP-bound actin (T form) prefers incorporation. ATP hydrolysis to ADP-Pi-actin, then slow Pi release to ADP-actin (D form). D form tends to dissociate.
- **End Conformation:** (+) end retains "flat" conformation, (-) end twisted "monomer-like" conformation. This underlies differential kinetics.
- **Treadmilling:** At steady state (G-actin concentration between Cc(+) and Cc(-)), net addition at (+) end balances net loss at (-) end. Creates a flux of subunits through a filament of constant length (T form at (+), D form at (-)).

### III. The Cytoskeleton in Mitosis and Cell Division

- **Overall Process:** Proliferating cells undergo radical cytoskeletal remodeling in M phase. MT-based spindle segregates chromosomes. Contractile actomyosin ring powers cytokinesis.
- **Phases of Mitosis (Revision):Interphase:** Cell growth, centrosome duplication, chromosome replication, sister chromatid cohesion.
- **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses, duplicated centrosomes separate, nucleate dynamic MTs. Interphase MT network disassembles.
- **Prometaphase:** Nuclear envelope breakdown (open mitosis). MT capture at kinetochores. Chromosomes congress to metaphase plate (under tension).
- **Metaphase:** Chromosomes aligned at metaphase plate, bi-oriented.
- **Anaphase Onset:** Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) satisfied. APC/C activated, degrades securin, releases separase, cleaves cohesins. Sister chromatids separate.
- **Anaphase A:** Chromosomes move poleward along shortening kMTs ("pacman" mechanism). Pole-pole distance constant.
- **Anaphase B:** Spindle poles move apart due to interpolar MT elongation.
- **Telophase:** Chromosomes at poles, NE reforms, chromatin decondenses.
- **Cytokinesis:** Follows mitosis. Animal cells: actomyosin contractile ring constriction. Yeast: ring + septum. Plants: cell plate (no ring, no centrioles).
- **The Mitotic Spindle: A MT-Based Machine:Self-Organized Bipolar Array:** MT (-) ends focused at poles, (+) ends vary.
- **MT Classes:Kinetochore MTs (kMTs):** Interact with kinetochores. In animal cells, kinetochore fibers (bundles of ~20 kMTs).
- **Interpolar MTs:** Non-kinetochore MTs, interact at overlaps with MTs from opposite pole (form spindle midzone).
- **Astral MTs (aMTs):** Extend to cell cortex.
- **Complexity:** More complex than simple 3 populations. MTs may branch, not all (-) ends at centrosome. K-fibers can contain MTs not reaching poles.
- **Pathways for MT Nucleation:Centrosome-Dependent:**Centrosome duplication in interphase (semiconservative).
- Increased MT dynamics, centrosome separation (driven by motors), maturation (recruit PCM, increase nucleation). Asters form.
- Antagonistic MAPs (XMAP215/TOG) and kinesin-13 control MT dynamics; balance shifts to depolymerization in M phase (CDK-mediated phosphorylation).
- "Search and capture": Dynamic MTs from centrosomes probe space, captured by kinetochores (lateral converted to end-on attachments).
- **Centrosome-Independent:**Can assemble bipolar spindles without centrosomes (e.g., cell-free Xenopus egg extracts with DNA-coated beads).
- **Motor-Driven Self-Organization:Chromokinesins (Kinesin-4, 10):** (+) end directed, bind chromatin, push parallel MT (-) ends away, form half-spindles.

- **MT-Dependent Nucleation:** Augmin complex recruits g-TuRCs to side of existing MTs (MT branching), amplifies MTs.
- **Kinetochore-dependent Nucleation:** Potential mechanism for initiating kinetochore capture.
- **Bipolarity at Metaphase:** Balance of pulling/pushing forces leads to dynamic alignment of chromosomes at metaphase plate, held under tension. Stabilizes proper MT attachments.
- **Poleward Flux (Metaphase):** Continuous treadmilling of MTs. Tubulin addition at (+) ends (equator) balances loss at (-) ends (poles). Demonstrated by photoactivatable tubulin or fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM).
- **Anaphase Dynamics:Anaphase A:** Chromosomes move poleward. kMTs shorten ("pacman" at (+) end). Poleward flux continues. Kinetochores remain tethered by CENP-E (Kinesin-7, (+) end directed), MCAK (Kinesin-13, depolymerase), and dynein ((-) end directed). Ndc80 complex is key.
- **Anaphase B:** Spindle poles separate.
- **Pushing:** Bipolar Kinesin-5 slides antiparallel MTs at midzone.
- **Pulling:** Cortically anchored dynein pulls on astral MTs.
- Flux ceases.
- **Central Spindle & Midbody:** Remnants of spindle form "central spindle" (telophase), then dense "midbody" (cytokinesis). Essential for division plane and abscission.

- **Exceptions:** Syncytium in Drosophila early embryo (incomplete cytokinesis), incomplete in Drosophila oogenic cyst. Yeast uses ring + septum. Plants use cell plate.
- **Spindle Orientation (Asymmetric Divisions):** Polarized cytoskeleton couples cell fate determinants with spindle alignment (e.g., C. elegans 1st embryo division). Cortical factors attract astral MTs to dictate pole position.
- **Positioning the Division Plane (Animals):Role of MTs:** MTs relay spatial signal to activate Rho at cell equator.
- **Centralspindlin:** Key regulator. Conserved complex (kinesin-6 (HsMKLP1) + RacGAP (HsMgcRacGAP)). Recruits/regulates proteins for furrow ingression and abscission.
- Assembly/MT binding inhibited until anaphase.
- Enriched at overlapping MT (+) ends in central spindle/aMTs.
- Activates RhoGEF (RacGAP also downregulates Rac), leading to cortical RhoGTP accumulation.
- RhoGTP activates formin (actin polymerization) and ROCK (Myosin II activation via MLC phosphorylation and MLC phosphatase inhibition).
- Remains tethered to plasma membrane.
- **Abscission:**Contractile ring disassembles. Intercellular bridge narrows.
- Midbody: Electron-dense structure, assembly platform for abscission machinery. Tethered to plasma membrane.

### Quiz Answer Key

1. Actin filaments predominantly exhibit treadmilling, where subunits add to the plus end and dissociate from the minus end, leading to a net flux through the filament. Microtubules, while capable of treadmilling, are primarily characterized by dynamic instability, involving stochastic and rapid switching between phases of growth and shrinkage.
2. Treadmilling in actin filaments describes a steady-state condition where the rate of G-actin addition to the fast-growing (+) end is balanced by the rate of G-actin loss from the slow-growing (-) end, resulting in a filament of constant length but with a net flow of subunits. During this, the (+) end contains ATP-bound actin subunits (T-form), while the (-) end contains ADP-bound actin subunits (D-form).
3. Profilin binds to actin monomers and promotes ADP/ATP exchange, making ATP-actin available for efficient addition to the fast-growing (+) end of filaments, thus promoting polymerization. Cofilin, on the other hand, binds to ADP-actin filaments, inducing depolymerization from the ends and severing of older filaments, thereby increasing the concentration of free ends and promoting overall actin turnover.
4. The ARP2/3 complex nucleates new actin filaments by mimicking an actin dimer/trimer and branching off from an existing filament, forming Y-branched actin networks crucial for lamellipodia. Formins, in contrast, promote the nucleation of unbranched, linear actin filaments by stabilizing an actin dimer/trimer and processively tracking the growing barbed end, which is important for structures like filopodia.
5. A processive motor is a motor protein that can travel long distances along its cytoskeletal track without detaching, by coordinating the mechanochemical cycles of its multiple motor heads. Myosin V is a prime example of a processive actin-based motor, moving in a continuous "hand-over-hand" fashion along actin filaments to transport vesicles.
6. Rho-like GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) act as molecular switches that are asymmetrically activated by external signals at the cell surface. Rac and Cdc42 activate Arp2/3 and formins respectively, inducing lamellipodia and filopodia at the leading edge. Rho activates formins and myosin II, promoting contraction at the cell rear, thereby coordinating actin organization to impart directionality to cell migration.
7. Beyond dynamic instability, microtubules also exhibit **treadmilling**, similar to actin filaments. In this process, tubulin subunits are added to the fast-growing (+) end and removed from the slow-growing (-) end, leading to a continuous flux of subunits through the microtubule while maintaining a relatively constant length, as observed in processes like poleward flux in the mitotic spindle.
8. The "template model" proposes that g-TuRCs act as a structural template for microtubule nucleation. The ring-shaped g-TuRCs accommodate the minus (-) ends of the 13 protofilaments that make up a microtubule, providing a pre-organized scaffold that facilitates the assembly of new tubulin heterodimers into a microtubule with the correct protofilament number and helical pitch.
9. During anaphase A, kinetochore microtubules shorten primarily via a "pacman" mechanism, where the kinetochore acts to depolymerize the microtubule (+) end while remaining attached. Key molecular players involved include CENP-E (a (+) end-directed kinesin that tethers the kinetochore), MCAK (a kinesin-13 that drives microtubule depolymerization), and dynein (a (-) end-directed motor that opposes CENP-E and leads the kinetochore toward the pole).
10. The Centralspindlin complex is a crucial regulator of cytokinesis in animal cells, acting to specify the position of the cleavage furrow. It concentrates at overlapping microtubule (+) ends in the central spindle and astral microtubules, where it recruits and activates RhoGEF. This leads to the accumulation of active RhoGTP at the cell equator, which then triggers the assembly and contractility of the actomyosin ring, driving furrow ingression.

- **Myosin:** A superfamily of actin-based motor proteins that use ATP hydrolysis to move along actin filaments, generating contractile force or transporting cargo. Myosin II is key for muscle contraction and cytokinesis.
- **Ndc80 Complex:** A key kinetochore subcomplex involved in forming stable attachments between kinetochores and microtubules during mitosis.
- **Nucleation:** The rate-limiting initial step in the polymerization of actin or tubulin, involving the formation of a stable oligomer (nucleus) that can then be elongated.
- **Pacman Mechanism:** A proposed mechanism for chromosome movement during anaphase A, where the kinetochore "eats" (depolymerizes) the plus end of the kinetochore microtubule while remaining attached.
- **Pericentriolar Material (PCM):** An electron-dense, amorphous matrix surrounding the centrioles within the centrosome, rich in g-tubulin and other proteins that nucleate microtubules.
- **Phalloidin:** A toxin that binds to and stabilizes filamentous actin (F-actin), preventing its depolymerization; often conjugated with fluorophores for visualization.
- **Plus-End Tracking Proteins (+TIPs):** Proteins that specifically associate with the growing (+) ends of microtubules, regulating their dynamics, promoting growth/rescue, and mediating interactions with other cellular structures.
- **Polarity:** The inherent structural asymmetry of actin filaments and microtubules, resulting from the head-to-tail arrangement of their subunits, leading to distinct "plus" and "minus" ends with different kinetic properties.
- **Poleward Flux:** A continuous flow of tubulin subunits through the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, where tubulin is added at the plus (+) ends near the equator and lost from the minus (-) ends near the poles, maintaining a dynamic steady state.
- **Profilin:** An actin-binding protein that promotes the exchange of ADP for ATP on G-actin monomers, facilitating their rapid addition to the fast-growing (+) ends of actin filaments.
- **Protofilament:** A linear chain of tubulin heterodimers that associate laterally with other protofilaments to form the cylindrical wall of a microtubule. Microtubules typically have 13 protofilaments.
- **Ran-GTP Gradient:** A gradient of RanGTP (GTP-bound Ran protein) established near chromatin during mitosis, which regulates the release of microtubule-associated proteins (like TPX2) from importins to promote centrosome-independent microtubule nucleation.
- **Rescue:** The rapid transition of a shrinking (depolymerizing) microtubule to a growing (polymerizing) state.
- **Rho-like GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42):** Small monomeric GTPases that act as molecular switches, cycling between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states, central to transducing external signals into cytoskeletal rearrangements for processes like cell polarity and migration.
- **ROCK (Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase):** An effector kinase of RhoGTP that phosphorylates myosin light chain and inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase, thereby activating myosin II and promoting contractility, crucial for cytokinesis and cell migration.
- **Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC):** A surveillance mechanism that monitors the attachment and tension of kinetochores to spindle microtubules, preventing anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly bi-oriented.
- **Stathmin:** A protein that sequesters tubulin dimers, thereby inhibiting microtubule polymerization and promoting depolymerization.
- **Stereocilia:** Long, stiff, actin-filled projections on the surface of hair cells in the inner ear, involved in mechanotransduction of sound.
- **Stress Fibers:** Contractile bundles of actin and myosin filaments found in non-muscle cells, often terminating at focal contacts, contributing to cell adhesion and tension generation.
- **Taxol:** A drug derived from Pacific yew that binds to and stabilizes microtubules, preventing their depolymerization and thereby disrupting normal microtubule dynamics and cell division.
- **Thymosin b4:** A protein that sequesters G-actin monomers, inhibiting spontaneous nucleation of actin filaments and maintaining a pool of unpolymerized actin in the cytosol.
- **Treadmilling:** A phenomenon observed in both actin filaments and microtubules at steady state, where subunits are continuously added to one end of the polymer and lost from the other end, resulting in a net flux of subunits through the polymer while its overall length remains constant.
- **Tubulin:** A globular protein that forms heterodimers of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin, which are the building blocks of microtubules.
- **TPX2:** A microtubule-associated protein that is activated by RanGTP near chromatin and promotes microtubule nucleation and stability in the centrosome-independent spindle assembly pathway.
