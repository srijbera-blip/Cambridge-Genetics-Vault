# Gene Expression and Nuclear Molecular Biology: A Comprehensive Study Guide

## I. Lecture 7: Introduction to Gene Expression and the Transcriptional Machinery

### A. Introduction to DNA as Genetic Material

- DNA's role as an information store: encoding complex data like Shakespeare's sonnets and TIFF images.
- Future potential of DNA for data storage, current limitations (cost of synthesis).
- Understanding how information in DNA is interpreted by cellular machines in nature.
- Fragmentary understanding of the human genome despite sequence availability.
- Gene expression: The process by which genetic material is read and interpreted to differentiate cell types.
- Importance of gene expression control for development, physiology, and its link to human diseases like cancer (e.g., Retinoblastoma gene locus).
- The "central dogma of molecular biology" (DNA -> RNA -> Proteins) and its biological exceptions (e.g., solely protein-based or protein/RNA complexes).
- Focus on transcription, particularly transcriptional initiation, as a key regulatory step in eukaryotes (RNA Pol II transcripts).

### B. Basics of Transcription

- **Directionality:** RNA synthesis in 5' to 3' direction, reading template DNA 3' to 5'.
- **Product:** RNA sequence equivalent to the non-template (coding) strand, with U instead of T.
- **Catalyst:** [[RNA polymerase II]].
- **Key Sites/Regions:**Start site (+1).
- Upstream sequences (-1 backwards): proximal promoter sequences and distal enhancer elements.
- [[Enhancers|Enhancer]] elements:  be within introns or downstream of the gene.
- [[Promoters|Promoter]] elements: Can be within the coding region (e.g., for snRNAs).

### C. RNA Polymerases (RNAP)

- Multi-protein complexes performing transcription.
- Common evolutionary origin across domains of life.
- **Three Primary Domains of Life:** Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
- **Bacteria & Archaea:** Lack nuclei and most predominant organelles, generally circular genomes.
- **Archaea:** Evolutionarily diverged from bacteria and eukaryotes, some features (basal transcription apparatus, replication) more similar to eukaryotes. Inhabit diverse environments, resemble bacteria morphologically (cell walls, circular genomes, cell division apparatus), lack complex cytoskeleton and predominant sub-cellular organelles.
- **Conservation of RNA Polymerases:Bacterial RNAP:** Four core subunits (2x alpha, beta, beta prime) + associated sigma (specificity subunit) for targeting specific genes.
- **Eukaryotic & Archaeal RNAP:** Larger number of subunits, large subunits related to bacterial ones, many smaller subunits in eukarya related to archaea.
- **Archaea:** Possess histone-like proteins forming nucleosome-like structures.
- **Structural Similarities of RNAPs:** DNA enters, strands melt in active site, DNA exits one channel, nascent RNA exits another. "Molecular machine" where DNA "spools through."
- **Transcription Factories:** Discrete sites of transcription in higher eukaryotes.
- **[[Topoisomerases]]:** Release super-helices ahead and behind the polymerase.
- **Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases (Pol I, II, III):**Located in the cell nucleus, share structural properties.
- Distinguished by function and sensitivity to alpha-amanitin (Pol II most sensitive, then Pol III; Pol I least sensitive).
- Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own bacterial/bacteriophage-ancestored RNAPs.
- **[[RNA Polymerase I ]](Pol I):** Produces rRNA precursors, transcribes genes in the nucleolus (tandem arrays, ~50% cellular RNA).
- **[[RNA Polymerase III]] (Pol III):** Synthesizes small stable RNAs (tRNAs, some snRNAs, 5S rRNA), genes scattered.
- **[[RNA Polymerase II]] (Pol II):** Transcribes protein-encoding genes (mRNAs) and some snRNAs (e.g., U2 snRNA).
- Huge number of genes (~35,000 in human).
- Transcripts can be very long.
- Highly regulated at initiation, but also at elongation, termination, splicing, poly-adenylation, export, stability.
- **Transcript Modifications:** Capping, splicing, poly-adenylation (capping and occasionally splicing also for Pol I/III). Splicing and poly-adenylation are linked to Pol II transcription and mRNA export.
- **Accessory Factors for RNAPs:** Required for accurate promoter recognition, regulated activity, processive elongation, and correct transcript processing.

### D. Bacterial RNA Polymerase and Sigma Factors

- **Sigma factors:** Bind RNAP to form the "[[holoenzyme]]."
- Sequence-specific DNA binding, targeting RNAP to adjacent sequences.
- Multiple sigma factors exist, each regulating a subset of genes (e.g., sigma70 for -10 to -35 promoter elements).
- Mediate global gene expression changes (e.g., sporulation, heat shock).
	-[[gene regulation]]

### E. Eukaryotic [[RNA Polymerase II]] Promoters and [[General Transcription Factors ]](GTFs)

- **Promoter Structure for Pol II:**Requires [[General Transcription Factors]] (TFIIs) for initiation.
- **[[Initiator]] (Inr):** Short, conserved sequence (Py2CAPy5) at the start point.
- **[[TATA box]]:** Common (~50% human genes), A-T-rich octamer ~25 bp upstream of start point.
- **[[Downstream Promoter Element]] (DPE):** Common in TATA-less promoters.
- **Core promoter:** Often Inr + TATA or Inr + DPE.
- **Assembly of Core Transcription Complex (Pre-initiation complex):[[TFIID]]:** Multi-protein complex (TBP + TAFs).
- **[[TATA-binding protein]] (TBP):** Binds TATA box in minor groove, ~30 bp upstream. Universal TF (also for [[RNA Polymerase I|Pol I]] & [[RNA Polymerase III|Pol III]]), highly conserved, forms a "molecular saddle" bending DNA.
- **[[TBP-associated factors]] (TAFs):** Some have histone-like folds. Functions: bind promoter sequences (important for TATA-less promoters), contacted by activators, "variant" TFIID complexes with tissue-specific characteristics.
- Nucleates assembly of other [[general transcription factors|GTFs]], helps determine start site.
- **[[TFIIA]]:** Binds and stabilizes TFIID-DNA interaction (three subunits).
- **[[TFIIB]]:** Bridges TFIID and [[RNA polymerase II|Pol II]], has sequence preference for BRE element upstream of TATA box, helps define start site.
- **Pol II + TFIIF:** TFIIF (RAP 30/74) binds Pol II, weak similarity to bacterial sigma factors.
- **TFIIE:** Two polypeptides.
- **[[TFIIH]]:**Contains helicase activities (ATP-dependent) for promoter "opening" (melting).
- Functions in DNA [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER preferentially targeted to transcribed regions/template strand).
- Contains kinase activity that phosphorylates the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD).
- **Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD):**On largest Pol II subunit (52 repeats of YSPTSPS in humans), conserved in eukaryotes (variable length).
- No CTD equivalent in Pol I, Pol III, Archaea, or Bacteria.
- Role: linked to Pol II processivity and coupling transcription to RNA splicing, poly-adenylation, and mRNA export.

### F. Gene Expression Beyond Transcription

- Nascent RNA transcripts undergo further processing: splicing, capping, tailing, export, translation, localization, degradation. Each step can control gene expression.
- Focus of lectures on transcriptional initiation as the major control step in most eukaryotes, but other mechanisms exist (e.g., _Leishmania_).
- Lecture 9 to cover RNA-dependent control (co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional).

### G. Methods for Studying Transcription

- **Biochemical (cell-free) transcription assays:**Recapitulate effects of factors binding proximal promoter regions _in vivo_.
- Uses nuclear extract, DNA template, ribonucleotides.
- Detects products by autoradiography (radioactive nucleotides) or quantification of cold RNA (e.g., primer extension).
- Advantages: Detailed mechanistic studies.
- Drawbacks: Only nearby DNA elements show activity (naked DNA vs. chromatin _in vivo_), chromatin effects not fully recapitulated (though enhancers can work over kb in some systems).
- **Need for genetic studies _in vivo_ (e.g., temperature-sensitive mutants) and structural studies.**

## II. Lecture 8: [[Basics - regulation of transcription in eukaryotes and genome and genomics|Regulation of Transcription in Eukaryotes]]

### A. Sequence-Specific Transcriptional Activators/Repressors (Transcription Factors)

- **Structure:** DNA binding domains (bind specific promoter sequences) and transcription activation/repression domains.
- Domains are often "[[Modularity|modular]]" in function.
- Influence transcription positively or negatively.
- **Mechanisms of Action:Direct recruitment of basal (general) transcription factors:** Influence rate of assembly or activity of [[general transcription factors|GTFs]].
- **Indirect recruitment of basal factors:** Mediated via a [[Coactivators|co-activator]]/[[Corepressors|corepressor]] (physical bridge).
- **Changes in chromatin structure:** Regulatory TF or co-activator can be a histone/chromatin modifying enzyme.
- **Repressors:** Interfere with/oppose activation mechanisms.
- **Polymerase "Release" (Pausing):**[[RNA polymerase II|RNAP II]] can be paused downstream of the [[Downstream Promoter Element|DPE]] (e.g., _Drosophila_ Hsp70 locus, developmentally regulated genes, embryonic stem cells).
- Paused RNAP II has Ser-5 CTD phosphorylation; release into elongation involves Ser-2 CTD phosphorylation.
- Allows rapid, synchronous transcriptional control and lower "background noise."
- Example: _Drosophila_ Dorsal-Ventral Patterning Genes (Table 1, Figure 3).
- **TAFs of TFIID:**Modulate transcription. TFIID works better than TBP in response to activators.
- TAFs are contacted by [[Activation domain|activation domains]] of regulatory factors, allowing synergy and combinatorial control.
- **Other Basal TFs contacted by regulatory factors:** E.g., viral activator VP16 binds TFIIB, altering its conformation to aid Pol II recruitment.
- **Mediator Complex:**Co-activator, ~20 polypeptide complex, conserved from yeast to humans.
- Interacts with Pol II CTD, activators, and functions overlap with TFIID.
- Brings together GTFs, RNAPII, and transcription factors.
- Similar function to SAGA complex.

### B. Regulating the Regulators (Transcription Factors)

- **1) Modulation of Factor Levels:**Example: HNF-1 in mammalian liver cells directs liver-specific gene expression.
- Identified by _in vitro_ transcription system: purified HNF-1 enables liver-specific gene transcription in spleen extracts.
- **2) Modulation of Intrinsic Activity:Ligand Binding (e.g., steroid hormone receptors):**Have [[DNA-binding domain|DNA binding domain]] (zinc-fingers), [[Activation domain|activation]]/[[repression domain]], and [[ligand-binding domain|hormone (ligand) binding domain]].
- Influence cellular functions (sexual development, metabolism).
- Hormone is membrane-permeable, enters cell, binds receptor.
- Example: Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding dissociates HSP90, exposes nuclear-localization-sequence, translocates to nucleus, binds target genes.
- Some receptors are constitutively nuclear; ligand binding activates transcriptional potential.
- Can also act as transcriptional repressors.
- **Control by Phosphorylation (e.g., p53):**p53 normally unstable.
- After DNA damage, phosphorylated by ATM/Chk2 kinases.
- Phosphorylation dissociates negative regulator Mdm2 (E3 Ubiquitin ligase targeting p53 for proteasomal degradation).
- p53 levels rise, binds target genes, activates transcription (e.g., Bax for apoptosis, p21 for cell cycle control).
- Consequence: cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

### C. Control of [[Chromatin Structure]]

- **Nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin:** Generally repressive to transcription (inhibit binding of TBP, other factors).
- **Chromatin's role:** "Dampens down" transcription, target for activators to relieve repression.
- **Histones:** H2A, H2B, H3, H4 (two of each in octamer).
- Compact core domains and N-terminal "tails."
- **Post-translational Modifications of Tails:** [[Acetylation]], phosphorylation, [[Methylation]] (mono-, di-, tri-), etc.
- Alter chromatin compaction, greatly influence transcription.
- **"[[Histone code hypothesis]]":** Modifications affect histone interactions and are recognized by chromatin-influencing proteins (e.g., HP1 binds H3K9me, leading to repressive state).
- **Histone [[Acetylation]]:**By Histone Acetyl-Transferases (HATs; e.g., CBP, p300, P/CAF).
- Generally positive for transcription: "open up" chromatin (neutralize positive charge of histone N-termini, change interaction partners).
- HATs (like CBP) can be co-activators.
- Removed by Histone Deacetylases (HDACs; e.g., SMRT, HDAC1-3).
- Generally repressive to transcription, can be [[Corepressors|corepressor]].
- **Histone Methylation:**Complex actions, depend on degree of methylation (mono-, di-, tri-).
- Does not remove positive charge.
- Can be activating or repressing.
- Enzymes: Histone Methyltransferases (e.g., SET, EZH2, PRC2 - Polycomb complex).
- Links between acetylation and methylation (e.g., protein complex binding methylated residues can have HDAC activity).
- Used for long-term programming of chromatin into transcriptionally inactive state (e.g., genomic imprinting).
- Demethylases identified (e.g., LSD1, KDM4).
- **Chromatin Remodeling Complexes:**Use ATP hydrolysis to "mobilize" nucleosomes (sliding, pushing).
- Examples: [[SWI-SNF|SWI/SNF]] complex, ISWI complexes.
- Provide co-activator function.
- SWI/SNF subunits mutated in >20% human cancers.
- **Case Study: RB and E2F:**RB (retinoblastoma gene) binds and inhibits E2F (sequence-specific regulatory factor).
- RB recruits HDACs, leading to transcriptional repression.
- In S-phase, RB is phosphorylated, dissociating from E2F.
- E2F then binds HATs, induces transcription of S-phase genes.
	- **Normal State (outside S-phase or when growth is suppressed):** In its active, unphosphorylated state, **RB binds to and inhibits the actions of the sequence-specific regulatory factor E2F**. This complex of RB and E2F also recruits Histone Deacetylases (HDACs), which leads to transcriptional repression of genes necessary for cell cycle progression
	- This effectively keeps the cell cycle from advancing.
	- Transition to S-phase (Normal Cell):** As cells are signaled to enter S-phase, **RB becomes phosphorylated**
	- This phosphorylation event causes **RB to dissociate from E2F**, thereby relieving its inhibitory influence
	- **E2F Activity in S-phase:** Once E2F is released and active, it **then binds to Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs)**
	- This interaction leads to the **induction of transcription of S-phase-specific genes**. These genes are crucial for DNA replication and other processes required for the cell to progress through S-phase
	- **Retinoblastoma Connection:** In the cancer predisposition condition retinoblastoma, RB is **defective**
	- When RB cannot properly bind and inhibit E2F (due to mutation or other defects), E2F remains constitutively active or becomes active prematurely. This leads to **uncontrolled transcription of S-phase genes**, promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation and contributing to tumor formation
	- In summary, RB acts as a crucial "brake" on cell cycle progression by inhibiting E2F, and its regulated phosphorylation in S-phase is what normally releases this brake, allowing E2F to drive the expression of genes needed for DNA replication

.
- **Case Study: Thyroid Hormone Receptor (TR)-RXR:**In absence of ligand (thyroid hormone), complex binds HDAC "SMRT," repressing transcription.
- Ligand binding dissociates SMRT, recruits CBP/p300 (HAT activity), leading to transcriptional activation.

### D. Methods for Studying DNA-Binding Proteins and Chromatin

- **DNA Footprinting:**Assays presence of DNA-binding proteins and their recognition sequences.
- 32P-label one DNA strand, add binding protein to one sample.
- Limited nuclease digestion (DNase I).
- Analyze cleaved ssDNA sizes by autoradiography on denaturing gel to find protected (binding) site.
- **Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) / [[ChIP-seq]]:**Direct evidence for binding sites of TFs in "living" cells.
- Crosslink chromatin and DNA binding proteins to DNA (formaldehyde).
- Shear DNA (sonication, enzymatic cleavage).
- Purify TF-DNA complexes using specific anti-TF antibody (on beads).
- Remove proteins (proteases), leaving pure DNA segment.
- Amplify DNA (PCR), then couple to microarray (ChIP-on-chip) or sequencing (ChIP-seq).
- Used for TFs, phosphorylated Pol II CTD, Pol II itself, chromatin modifications.
- Revolutionized understanding of chromatin landscape (ENCODE, modENCODE projects).

### E. Multiple Transcription Factors and Gene Regulatory Networks

- **[[Combinatorial control|Combinatorial transcriptional response]]:** Multiple TFs act together, integrating inputs.
- Promoter complexity increases with organismal complexity.
- **Gene regulatory networks:** TFs regulating TFs, forming hierarchies ("transcriptional cascade").
- **Master regulators:** TFs at top of hierarchy (e.g., MyoD driving muscle differentiation).
- Yamanaka factors: 4 TFs sufficient to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent cells (iPS).
- Gene regulation better viewed as a network than a hierarchy.
- Partial understanding of transcriptional networks, ultimate goal: understand development from zygote.
- **Evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks:**[[Cis-acting elements|Cis elements]] in DNA vs. trans-acting TFs.
- **Hypotheses:** Cis elements change (non-coding change) to alter TF binding OR TF structure changes to recognize different elements.
- Experiments suggest DNA changes (cis elements) can evolve faster (single base-pair change can create/remove binding site).
- Example: Tc1 mouse (human chromosome 21 in mouse genome) shows human DNA's binding patterns in mouse liver, suggesting DNA wins over proteins.
- GRNs need to be examined in evolutionary context.

### F. Distant Cis Elements (Enhancers)

- **[[Enhancers]]:** Distant regulatory elements, often millions of bases away, can be separated by genes they don't regulate.
- **Mechanism:** DNA looping brings enhancers into close contact with promoters.
- Mediator complex, [[general transcription factors|GTFs]], co-activators integrate RNAPII and TF assembly.
- **Models for enhancer function:Enhanceosome:** Highly intricate arrangement of factors, every base-pair matters (e.g., IFN-β enhancer). Forms stable complex, functions as a unit.
- **Billboard:** Mostly independent elements loosely collaborate.
- **DNA Looping Regulation:Insulators:** Regulated by CTCF transcription factor.
- **CTCF:** Binds DNA elements, can homodimerize, interacts with cohesins ("molecular rubber bands").
- CTCF binding sites enforce DNA looping, can insulate genes from enhancers.
- Regulation by chromatin state, DNA methylation.
- CTCF often found at transitions between chromatin states, forming "boundaries."
- **Experimental approach:** HiC, ChIA-PET to examine DNA looping.

## III. Lecture 9: Epigenetics and Non-coding RNA

### A. [[Epigenetics]]: Concept and Examples

- **Definition:** Heritable information beyond primary DNA sequence, or structural adaptation of chromosomal regions to register/perpetuate altered activity states.
- **Waddington (1940s):** Coined "epigenetics" to describe phenotype manifestation from genotype.
- Much "epigenetics" already discussed in Lecture 8 (histone modifications, chromatin).
- [[Position-Effect Variegation]] (PEV):**Chromosomal domains inherit chromatin state through mitosis (e.g., constitutive heterochromatin).
- Boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin have limited precision.
- **Fruit Flies (White gene):** Translocation of White gene near heterochromatin boundary leads to silencing in some cells but not others (white vs. red patches in eye).
- Once expression state (euchromatin/heterochromatin) is set in a cell, daughter cells maintain it.
- Example of epigenetic inheritance through mitosis.
- Genetic screens for PEV modifiers identified chromatin regulators ("Su-Var" genes).

### B. [[Polycomb group (PcG)|Polycomb]] and Chromatin Memory

- Regulation of gene expression coupled to cellular memory maintaining identity during development.
- **Homeotic genes (fruit fly):** Spatially-restricted TF expression provides body plan info.
- **Chromatin-based mechanism ([[Trithorax group (TrxG)|Trithorax]] and [[Polycomb group (PcG)|Polycomb]] pathways):** Provide memory/maintenance of gene expression through cell divisions.
- **Polycomb Response Element (PRE):**Enhancer provides initial spatial information, functions early.
- PRE provides memory function, maintains expression even without TFs.
- Polycomb and Trithorax pathways act via complex chromatin modification/maintenance.
- **Mechanisms of Silencing (Polycomb):**PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) trimethylates histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3) via EZH2's SET domain. PRC2 binding to H3K27me3 stimulates its activity (self-reinforcing).
- PRC1 binds H3K27me3 (via Pc's chromodomain), catalyzes H2AK118 monoubiquitylation (via RING subunit), and compacts chromatin.
- H2A ubiquitylation correlates with poised Pol II.
- **Mechanisms of Activation (Trithorax):**TrxG proteins (e.g., Ash1, Trx) are histone methyltransferases counteracting PcG silencing.
- Ash1 methylates H3K36.
- Trx C-ter methylates H3K4 at promoters (via SET domain), interacts with CBP (HAT), facilitating H3K27 acetylation.
- Trx N-ter also interacts with CBP and facilitates H3K27ac.
- Histone Lys acetylation neutralizes positive charge, increases DNA accessibility.
- Fsh (BRD4 homolog) binds acetylated Lys, phosphorylates Pol II CTD at Ser2, promoting elongation.
- **Antagonistic Interactions:** H3K4me and H3K36me inhibit PRC2. H3K27ac and H3K27me are mutually exclusive. Acetylation counteracts compaction.

### C. [[DNA Methylation]]

- Another "epigenetic mark," often lost during evolution.
- Important for genome defense, gene regulation, epigenetics (vertebrates and plants).
- **CpG Methylation:** C-G DNA context methylation is symmetric, allowing memory maintenance through replication.
- **DNMT1:** Maintains DNA methylation.
- **DNMT3 family:** Carries out de novo methylation.
- **TET enzyme family:** Actively removes DNA methylation via oxidation.
- Plays a role in evolution: changes in CpG dinucleotides and GC content can alter methylation landscape. TF binding can create unmethylated domains in CpG-poor regions. Insertion of transposable elements can create novel CpG dinucleotides.

### D. [[Genomic Imprinting]]

- Epigenetic phenomenon observed in mammals.
- Paternal and maternal alleles have different methylation patterns at fertilization.
- Methylation usually associated with gene inactivation.
- Embryo survival depends on receiving a functional allele from the parent with the unmethylated allele.
- Survival of heterozygotes differs based on cross direction.
- Imprinted genes occur in clusters, often with a local control site for de novo methylation.
- Famous example: IGF2 locus.

### E. [[Non-coding RNAs]] as Regulators of Gene Expression

- Revolution in understanding RNA regulatory mechanisms.
- Classes: microRNAs (miRNAs), siRNAs, piRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, lincRNAs).
- **miRNAs:**Small (~22nt) single-stranded RNAs.
- Hundreds in mammals, regulate up to 30% of human genes.
- Transcribed mostly by RNAPII, often tissue-specific.
- **Processing:** Primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) processed by Drosha and Dicer into mature miRNAs.
- Bound by [[Argonaute]] proteins.
- Bind to target mRNAs through base-pairing (mismatches allowed in animals).
- Inhibit translation and destabilize target mRNAs.
- Essential for animal and plant development.
- **RNAi and siRNAs:**Related pathway to miRNAs.
- Long dsRNA processed by Dicer into short (~23nt) siRNAs.
- Bound by Argonaute proteins.
- **RISC complex:** siRNA + Argonaute.
- Argonaute has "slicing" activity: cuts target RNA at binding site, leading to degradation.
- Discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) led to Nobel Prize (Fire & Mello).
- Experimental tool, therapeutic potential, important in antiviral immunity.
- **piRNAs:**Expressed in the germline.
- Target RNA produced by transposable elements.
- Lack of piRNA pathway leads to infertility ("guardians of the genome").
- Provide a "memory" of transposable elements.
- Bind to specialized Argonaute proteins called Piwi proteins.
- Act in cytoplasm (post-transcriptional gene regulation, PTGS) and nucleus (transcriptional gene regulation, TGS).
- **siRNAs and piRNAs can regulate transcription and heterochromatin formation:**Nuclear RNAi-like phenomena in yeasts, plants, nematodes linked to transcriptional repression via chromatin modification (TGS, coTGS).
- piRNA pathway can also do this.
- **Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs):**"Newest kids on the block," but Xist (X inactivation) known since 1990s.
- Diverse roles/mechanisms:
- Structural RNAs in transcription, chromatin regulation.
- Transcription process affects local chromatin structure.
- Antisense transcription, transcription of enhancers.
- Constitute much of "transcriptional noise" (>80% human genome transcribed, ~2% coding).
- **Models of action:Decoys:** Titrate away DNA-binding proteins (TFs).
- **Scaffolds:** Bring proteins into complex/spatial proximity.
- **Guides:** Recruit proteins (e.g., chromatin modification enzymes) to DNA (via RNA-DNA interactions or RNA-protein interactions).
- **Chromosome looping:** Enhancer-like model, defining cis nature and spread of effect.

### F. What is a Gene?

- Term not satisfactorily defined (differs for geneticist vs. molecular biologist).
- Molecular biology perspective: Contiguous sequence of genomic DNA encoding a single functional RNA.
- **Issues to consider:**miRNAs can be polycistronic (metazoa, prokaryotes, some unicellular eukaryotes).
- Trans-splicing to RNAs from different genomic locations.
- Inclusion of enhancer/promoter elements in definition.
- **Practical approach:** Consider context.

## Quiz Answer Key

1. DNA's interpretation, known as gene expression, dictates the unique characteristics of different cell types. While all cells (except mature B and T cells, or red blood cells) contain the same genetic material copied from the zygote, the selective reading of this information determines cell differentiation and function. Aberrant regulation of this process can lead to diseases like cancer.
2. Bacteria and archaea both lack nuclei and predominant organelles, generally possessing circular genomes. However, archaea are evolutionarily as divergent from bacteria as they are from eukaryotes, and their basal transcription apparatus and replication system share more similarities with eukaryotes. While bacteria have a simpler RNA polymerase with a sigma factor, archaeal and eukaryotic polymerases have a larger number of subunits.
3. The three eukaryotic RNA polymerases (Pol I, II, and III) are primarily distinguished by the types of genes they transcribe and their differing sensitivities to alpha-amanitin. Pol I produces rRNA precursors, Pol II transcribes protein-encoding genes (mRNAs), and Pol III synthesizes small stable RNAs like tRNAs and 5S rRNA.
4. The RNA Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) is a unique feature to eukaryotic Pol II, consisting of conserved YSPTSPS repeats, and is absent in Pol I, Pol III, Archaea, and Bacteria. Its phosphorylation by TFIIH is crucial for transcription initiation, and it plays a role in regulating Pol II processivity while linking transcription to RNA splicing, poly-adenylation, and mRNA export.
5. Paused RNA polymerase II refers to a state where RNAPII is already bound to a promoter, often with Ser-5 of its CTD phosphorylated, but has not fully initiated elongation. This pausing, often downstream of the DPE, allows for rapid and synchronous transcriptional activation upon a signal, and can potentially lower "background noise" transcription, enabling fine-tuned control.
6. Histone acetyl-transferases (HATs) add acetyl groups to histone tails, neutralizing their positive charge and leading to an "opening up" of chromatin structure, which generally promotes transcription. Conversely, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove these acetyl groups, increasing positive charge and promoting chromatin compaction, thus generally repressing transcription.
7. A Polycomb Response Element (PRE) is a DNA sequence that provides a memory function for gene expression maintenance through many rounds of cell division, ensuring cellular identity throughout development. Unlike an enhancer, which provides the initial spatial information and functions early, the PRE maintains the expression pattern even in the absence of the transcription factors that initially set it.
8. In vertebrates, DNA methylation plays important roles in genome defense, gene regulation, and epigenetics. Maintenance methylation, carried out by DNMT1, faithfully copies existing methylation patterns across cell divisions, particularly at symmetric CpG sites. De novo methylation, carried out by the DNMT3 family, establishes new methylation patterns in previously unmethylated regions.
9. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are primarily transcribed by RNAPII as primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). These are then processed by the RNases Drosha and Dicer into mature, short (~22 nucleotide) single-stranded miRNAs. These mature miRNAs are then bound by Argonaute proteins and function by binding to target mRNAs through base-pairing (often with mismatches) to inhibit their translation and destabilize them.
10. Beyond their cytoplasmic role in post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGS), siRNAs and piRNAs can also regulate transcription and heterochromatin formation in the nucleus, a process known as transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) or co-transcriptional gene silencing (coTGS). This nuclear RNAi-like pathway, well-defined in organisms like S. pombe and nematodes, links small RNAs to chromatin modification and transcriptional repression.
