## Quiz Answer Key

1. The lack of a nuclear membrane in prokaryotes allows for coupled transcription and translation, meaning these processes can occur simultaneously. This direct coupling enables rapid and efficient gene expression and also facilitates regulatory mechanisms like attenuation.
2. The bacterial nucleoid contains the compacted chromosome along with DNA binding and bending proteins like HNS, HU, FIS, and IHF. These proteins organize the DNA into supercoiled loop domains, allowing it to fit within the cell while remaining accessible for replication and transcription.
3. Negative supercoiling refers to the underwound state of prokaryotic circular DNA, where approximately 4% of the helix turns are removed, introducing torsional strain. DNA gyrase (a type II topoisomerase) actively introduces negative supercoils, while topoisomerase I (a type I topoisomerase) relaxes them, maintaining a constant level.
4. In the _trp_ operon, high tryptophan levels cause ribosomes to translate the leader peptide completely, leading to the formation of a 3:4 hairpin that terminates transcription. When tryptophan is scarce, ribosomes stall, allowing a 2:3 hairpin to form, which prevents terminator formation and permits transcription of the _trp_ genes.
5. Bacterial plasmids are small, extrachromosomal DNA molecules that replicate independently and can transfer horizontally between bacteria. They carry non-essential genes that often confer selective advantages, such as antibiotic resistance, allowing for rapid adaptation and evolution of bacterial populations.
6. Low copy number plasmids (e.g., F, P1) employ active partition systems, using protein complexes and cytoskeletal-like elements to ensure precise segregation to daughter cells. High copy number plasmids (e.g., ColE1) generally rely on random distribution, with their high numbers making loss to daughter cells statistically improbable.
7. The "dimer catastrophe" occurs when multicopy plasmids form multimers (especially dimers) through homologous recombination, which are less efficiently partitioned, leading to rapid clonal accumulation of plasmid-free cells. The _cer-Xer_ system, a site-specific recombination system, resolves these multimers back into monomers, restoring stability.
8. Site-specific recombination differs from homologous recombination in that it does not require extensive DNA sequence homology between the recombining sites. Instead, it relies on specific recombinase enzymes that bind to short, defined DNA sequences at the recombination sites to mediate strand cutting, exchange, and religation.
9. In the "cut and paste" mechanism, the IS element's transposase recognizes and cuts at the inverted repeats flanking the IS, excising it from the donor DNA. The same transposase then makes staggered cuts in a new target DNA site, and the IS element is ligated into this new location.
10. The Tn3 family of transposable elements is of considerable clinical significance because they frequently carry genes for antibiotic resistance. Their replicative transposition mechanism and ability to move between different genetic locations (e.g., chromosomes and plasmids) contribute significantly to the rapid spread of resistance to novel antibiotics in bacterial populations.
