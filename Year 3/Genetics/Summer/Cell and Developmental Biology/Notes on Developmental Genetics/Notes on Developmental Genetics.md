- **Cleavage:** Sequential cell divisions, blastomeres.
- **Compaction:** At 8-cell stage, E-cadherin, apicobasal polarity, morula.
- **Cell Fate Decisions:** First decision: Trophectoderm (TE) vs. Inner Cell Mass (ICM), influenced by cell position (Hippo signaling – high cell contacts in inner cells, low in outer cells leading to Cdx2 upregulation) and cell polarity (asymmetrical inheritance of apical domain). Second decision: ICM differentiates into Epiblast and Primitive Endoderm (PrE).
- **Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs):** Negative feedback loops between transcription factors (Cdx2/Oct4 for TE/ICM; Nanog/Gata6 for Epiblast/PrE) ensure binary cell fate choices. FGF4 signaling maintains proportions of Epiblast/PrE cells.
- **Blastocyst Formation:** Outer cells form tight junctions, microlumens coalesce to form blastocoel. TE forms placenta, PrE forms part of yolk sac, Epiblast forms embryo proper.

### Lecture 2: Regulative Development & Stem Cells

- **Regulative Development:** Concept that early embryonic cells are plastic and can regulate their development to form a complete organism even after perturbation (e.g., dividing an 8-cell mouse embryo). Demonstrated by producing normal blastocysts and offspring from half/double embryos, and by chimera experiments (single blastomere contributing to all germ layers) and tetraploid complementation assays (single blastomere forming complete embryo).
- **Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD):** Use of regulative development for screening IVF embryos.
- **Cellular Potency:** Progressive reduction in a cell's potential as it differentiates.
- **Waddington's Epigenetic Landscape:** Metaphor for differentiation as a ball rolling down valleys, representing sequential binary cell fate decisions and discrete cell states. Highlights stochasticity and the context-dependent nature of signals (selective vs. inductive).
- **Stem Cells:Adult Stem Cells:** Maintain homeostasis, multipotent (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells).
- **Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs):** Pluripotent, self-renewing, derived from ICM (mouse ESCs) or post-implantation epiblast (Epiblast Stem Cells, EpiSCs, and human ESCs). Culture conditions (MEFs, LIF, BMP) promote pluripotency.
- **Diapause:** Mouse-specific quirk that may explain indefinite pluripotency of mouse ESCs in vitro.

### Lecture 3: Gastrulation and the Formation of the Body Plan

- **Gastrulation:** Morphological process following implantation.
- **Key Events:** Establishment of primary body axes (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, medio-lateral, left-right). Generation and spatiotemporal organization of three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm).
- **Axis Specification (Mouse):** Anterior Visceral Endoderm (AVE) secretes (Nodal and Wnt) inhibitors, moving to one side to define the anterior. Primitive streak forms at the posterior.
- **Cell Migration:** Epiblast cells migrate through the primitive streak, differentiating into mesoderm and endoderm. Neuromesodermal Progenitors (NMPs) contribute to neural and mesodermal lineages.
- **Left-Right Asymmetry:** Node (anterior to primitive streak) specifies left side via cilia rotation and biased gene expression. Situs inversus is a condition when this goes wrong.
- **Body Plan:** Initial organization of all early primordia of organs and tissues.
- **Phylotypic Stage/Hourglass Model:** Convergence of developmental timelines across different species at a highly similar stage (phylotypic stage), despite differences in early and late development. Hox genes theorized to be responsible for this convergence.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250825201949.png]]
- **Hox Genes:** Conserved across species, colinearity (order on chromosome mirrors expression along A-P axis), specify position of cell fates. Mutations cause homeotic transformations (e.g., antennae to legs in _Drosophila_).
- **Human Gastrulation:** Differs morphologically from mouse (flat disc-shaped epiblast vs. cup-shaped), but similar underlying processes (primitive streak, mesendoderm migration).
- **Carnegie Stages/Collections:** Historical collections of human embryos used to define developmental stages.
- **Human Embryo Research:** IVF allows _in vitro_ culture up to ~Day 13. "Day 14 Rule" in the UK (primitive streak formation, "individualization") limits _in vitro_ culture. "Black box" of human development refers to the poorly understood gastrulation period.
- **Morphogenesis and Organogenesis:** "Sculpting" of distinctive shapes and organs.
- **Neural Tube Development (Neurulation):** Ectoderm forms neural plate, then folds into neural tube (precursor to CNS). Notochord (ventral) signals (Shh) to pattern the neural tube, creating a D-V axis (dorsal interneurons, ventral motor neurons). Cell shape changes (MHP, DLHPs) drive folding. "Zippering" closure along A-P axis. Neural Tube Defects (NTDs) like spina bifida and anencephaly occur if closure fails.
- **Somitogenesis:** Formation of bilaterally paired somites (precursors to vertebrae, muscle, bone, skin) from paraxial mesoderm. Occurs sequentially A-P. Hox genes specify axial position.
- **Segmentation Clock:** Internal Hes/Her gene oscillation in pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) cells (negative feedback loop of protein repressing its own transcription).
- **Notch Signaling:** Couples cells, synchronizing oscillations into a travelling wave.
- **Wavefront Model:** Signaling gradients (Wnt/BMP posteriorly, Retinoic Acid anteriorly) create a "wavefront" where cells stop oscillating and differentiate based on Hes/Her levels.
- **Evolutionary Plasticity:** Changes in clock speed (e.g., snakes vs. mice/humans) lead to morphological differences.
- **Summary:** Mammalian development is a series of sequential, binary fate decisions, coordinated across scales by GRNs, cell communication, and global patterning. Model systems and _in vitro_ techniques (stem cells, embryo-like models) are crucial for understanding normal and abnormal development.

## Quiz Answer Key

1. The discovery of dramatic "genetic monsters" like homeotic mutants (e.g., antennae replaced by legs) in _Drosophila_ provided concrete evidence that specific genes control the development of entire body parts. This shifted embryology from mere description to a genetic and molecular approach, allowing biologists to identify and characterize the genes responsible for generating biological form.
2. Housekeeping genes encode proteins essential for fundamental cellular processes in all cells (e.g., metabolism), while toolkit genes specifically control the development of organs, tissues, cell types, and overall body plan. Mutations in toolkit genes typically result in discrete developmental defects, whereas mutations in housekeeping genes are often lethal due to widespread cellular dysfunction.
3. Colinearity refers to the fascinating phenomenon where the order of Hox genes on the chromosome corresponds to the order of the body regions, from head to tail, that they influence. This spatial and temporal correlation is observed in both _Drosophila_ gene complexes and vertebrate Hox clusters, suggesting a deeply conserved evolutionary principle.
4. Bicoid protein is a maternally derived transcription factor that forms a concentration gradient along the anteroposterior axis of the _Drosophila_ embryo, with high concentration at the anterior. Different target genes (like gap genes) respond to specific threshold concentrations of Bicoid, thus being activated in distinct spatial domains and providing positional information for anterior patterning.
5. Alternative RNA splicing is crucial in _Drosophila_ sex determination because it produces different protein isoforms from the same gene in a sex-specific manner. For example, the _doublesex_ (dsx) gene's primary transcript is spliced differently in males and females, leading to distinct Dsx protein isoforms that regulate sex-specific gene expression and differentiation.
6. _Sonic hedgehog_ (Shh) plays diverse roles in vertebrate development, including establishing the anteroposterior polarity of limbs and digits by acting as a morphogen from the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA). It is also expressed in the neural tube's floor plate, where its signaling is critical for subdividing brain hemispheres and eyes.
7. The Hippo signaling pathway senses cell contacts; inner cells of the morula have more contacts, leading to higher Hippo signaling levels. This results in the outer cells having lower Hippo signaling, which upregulates the transcription factor Cdx2, a marker for Trophectoderm fate. This mechanism, combined with cell polarity, mediates the inside-outside cell fate decision.
8. Waddington's Epigenetic Landscape is a metaphor that describes cell differentiation as a ball rolling down a contoured landscape, where valleys represent stable cell states and branching paths represent binary cell fate decisions. The landscape's topology is shaped by gene interactions, illustrating how cells progressively lose potency and commit to specific lineages over time.
9. The "Day 14 Rule" in human embryo research is a legal and ethical guideline, primarily in the UK, that prohibits culturing human embryos _in vitro_ beyond 14 days post-fertilization. Its scientific rationale is that around Day 14, the primitive streak forms, marking the point of "individualization" where twinning is no longer possible and the embryo is considered to have established its basic body plan.
10. The clock-and-wavefront model explains somitogenesis by combining an internal "segmentation clock" and a "wavefront." PSM cells oscillate through Hes/Her gene expression (the clock), synchronized by Notch signaling into traveling waves. A positional "wavefront," set by signaling gradients (e.g., Wnt/BMP and Retinoic Acid), defines where cells exit the oscillatory state and differentiate into somites, determining their anterior-posterior position.

## Essay Format Questions

- **Situs Inversus:** A congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions.
- **Somites:** Bilaterally paired blocks of mesoderm that form sequentially along the anterior-posterior axis of vertebrate embryos, giving rise to vertebrae, ribs, skeletal muscle, and dermis.
- **Somitogenesis:** The process of sequential formation of somites from the paraxial mesoderm.
- **_Sonic hedgehog_ (Shh):** A vertebrate gene homologous to _Drosophila hedgehog_, encoding a secreted signaling protein with diverse roles in patterning limbs, the neural tube, and other structures.
- **Spatial Control Region (SCR):** A specific sequence in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of an mRNA molecule that is recognized by RNA-binding proteins or miRNAs, regulating the spatial pattern of its translation (e.g., in _C. elegans_ _glp-1_ mRNA).
- **Stem Cells:** Undifferentiated cells that have the ability to self-renew (divide indefinitely) and differentiate into specialized cell types.
- **Syncytium:** A multinucleated cell or tissue where the nuclei share a common cytoplasm, often found in early _Drosophila_ embryos where proteins can diffuse freely.
- **Targeted Therapies:** Cancer treatments designed to specifically interfere with molecular pathways involved in cancer cell growth, progression, and spread, while minimizing harm to normal cells.
- **Tetraploid Complementation Assay:** An experiment used to demonstrate the pluripotency of individual blastomeres, where a single diploid blastomere is combined with a tetraploid host embryo, and the diploid cell alone forms the entire embryo proper.
- **Transcription Factors:** Proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences (cis-acting regulatory elements) to regulate the transcription of genes, either activating or repressing their expression.
- **_transformer_ (tra):** A _Drosophila_ gene involved in sex determination, encoding a splicing factor that regulates the alternative splicing of the _doublesex_ (dsx) gene.
- **Translational Control:** Regulation of gene expression that occurs at the level of protein synthesis (translation of mRNA into protein), often mediated by RNA-binding proteins or microRNAs.
- **Trophectoderm (TE):** The outer layer of cells of the blastocyst that will give rise to the placenta and other extraembryonic tissues.
- **_Utrabithorax_ (Ubx):** A _Drosophila_ Hox gene in the Bithorax complex that controls segmental identity in the posterior thorax and abdomen, and specifically promotes hind-wing development.
- **Zona Pellucida:** A thick, transparent outer membrane that surrounds the mammalian egg, playing a role in sperm binding and preventing polyspermy.
- **Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA):** A signaling center in the posterior part of the developing vertebrate limb bud that produces _Sonic hedgehog_ (Shh) as a morphogen to establish the anteroposterior polarity of the limb and digits.
- **Zygote:** A diploid cell formed by the fusion of a male and female gamete during fertilization, the first cell of a new organism.
- **Zygotically Active Genes:** Genes whose products are encoded by the embryo's own genome and are expressed after fertilization, in contrast to maternal-effect genes.
