### **Summary**

Autism has always been associated with a higher prevalence of males, right from Leo Kanner’s original study. This dissertation will be analysing the potential sources of this male excess, and whether it can be attributed entirely to genetics. The excess is around 4:1, but varies throughout the literature. While historical theories have suggested that autism is due to cold, uncaring “refrigerator mothers”, current research instead suggests a strong biological origin.

Genetic causes can generally be broken down into syndromic factors and non-syndromic factors. The former comprises genes where a single latter-presenting can be attributed to a specific mutation, whereas the latter comprises genes that can accumulate in an individual to increase risk of autism presentation, without the clear single mutation-phenotype link. This presents important when looking at the genetic liability of an especially as this is a potential genetic explanation for the male excess.

Non-genetic causes encompass a wide variety of reasons, including those which seem to decrease the rate at which females with autism are diagnosed. This can be due to socioeconomic, cultural, or diagnostic factors, and females may present autism differently to males. Additionally, because the excess has been so profound in the literature since Kanner, there is an existing presumption amongst both carers and clinicians that autism is something that predominantly affects males, meaning they are less likely to diagnose or refer females with the condition.

Autism is a complex condition, and is hence more commonly known as ‘Autistic Spectrum Disorder’ in the present day. Individuals of both sexes invariably present the condition differently, which inherently complicates the diagnosis process. Looking to the future, it may help to broaden our definition of what autism could be considered, and lessen the current ‘required symptoms’ for a successful diagnosis.

### **1. Introduction**

In 1943, Leo Kanner described the first documented cases of “early infantile autism”, a set of symptoms related to various, clearly marked deficiencies in social development of 11 children compared with their peers (Kanner, 1944). Nowadays, we understand autism to be a complex development condition, underpinning a broader scope of ‘neurodivergency’. It is therefore more commonly referred to as ‘Autistic Spectrum Disorder’ in more modern literature. For the sake of consistency, ‘autism’ will be used in this essay to describe both the older definition and the newer understanding of ASD.

Since Kanner (1944), however, as understanding of autism has only increased, one fact has remained almost universally consistent - this “disturbance of affective contact” has been predominantly diagnosed in boys, something noted and commented on throughout the literature from the 1940s right to the 2020s. In order to understand this ‘male excess’, it will be necessary to look into the causes of autism, and identify the potential points at which a male excess could arise. Particularly, genetic factors will be examined in detail, in order to determine whether they could provide the exclusive reasons for this. These will be contrasted with other potential factors, and whether these prevent an entirely genetic basis for the excess.

The World Health Organisation (2019) lists a few “Essential (Required) Features” for a diagnosis of autism, and these are very similar to the diagnostic criteria for autism laid out by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). Overall, the critical components are: difficulties in social communication; repetitive & inflexible behaviour; and deficiencies in social awareness. Asperger’s is defined by the WHO (2019) as a subset of ASD, where it is used to describe specific cases of autism where intelligence and flexible behaviours are at least average for an individual’s age, and there is little to no impairment in an individual’s ability to use language to express personal needs or desires.

For the scope of this essay, ‘male’ is defined entirely as an individual’s sex, and has nothing to do with their gender identity. Furthermore, as autism is a developmental and psychological condition, there are inherent differences between the rate of presentation and the rate of diagnosis. This essay will primarily be focusing on the excess in the latter, as there can be factors that affect diagnosis that are independent of presentation. The focus will primarily be on autism in the United Kingdom and the United States, as the vast majority of the literature originates from these two countries and speculating on different countries is not conducive to an evidence-based conclusion.

It is necessary at this point to acknowledge that at least some part is played by both genetic and non-genetic factors - the fact there is a perceived tendency for males to be diagnosed with autism leads to an inevitable bias in research towards autistic males. Therefore, the ‘exclusively’ part of the title will be defined as such: if the male excess in diagnoses would remain largely the same and not decrease significantly if the non-genetic factors were to be removed, it can be concluded that the excess is derived entirely genetically. However, if the non-genetic factors increase the various elements that lead to a male excess, it is first necessary to determine what it. The ‘Male Excess’ is, its historical surrounding, and whether there is any consensus in the literature on the it. Then, the historical theories surrounding the research of autism and how it has developed will be explained. Each other, before a conclusion is reached.

### **2. Is there a ‘Male Excess’?**

In the 11 cases of “autistic disturbances” first reported, 8 were boys and only 3 were girls (Kanner, 1943). Furthermore, out of the same author’s first 100 cases, the ratio was 80/20 (Rimland, 1965). Generally, this is literature refers to an (approximate) 4:1’ ratio between boys and girls almost universally. The literature refers to an (approximate) 4:1’ ratio between boys and girls almost universally. This is constituent with other development or other psychological conditions that develop during childhood having a male excess, although the criticism in these such as a strong as that autism is far more likely in boys than girls’ excess, as these are not as extreme as with autism (Wing, 1981). This however begs further criticism in these such as a strong as presumption that ‘autism is far more likely in boys than girls’ already influences methodology in modern studies specifically at the age of this are made by analysing existing clinical populations of those with autism specifically in the aforementioned ratio, and this may lead to diagnostic bias towards behaviours shown more in males than in females (Kreiser & White, 2014).

It should be noted, however, that this ratio is not consistent or agreed upon in the literature, ranging from 2:1 to as extreme as 8:1 (Loomes et al., 2017). This disparity partially arises from differences in study methodology, particularly differences in the age of autism cases the between that of boys and girls, the perceived male bias in autism leads to a decrease in the likelihood of girls, particularly those with mental impairment, from getting referred at an earlier age and are hence more likely to survey at a later age and are hence more likely to pick up the male excess than those surveyed at a later age, and hence tend towards the extreme end of the ratio range.

In addition to an age disparity arising from methodological decisions, another issue that this identifies is the issue of a ‘male-led’ autism diagnosis. Due to the historical male excess that begins all the way from Kanner (1944), there is a perceived set of ‘behaviours’ that occur in autistic boys that do not necessarily present identically in girls. Giareilli et al. (2010) identified aggression and hyperactivity as two behaviours that were presented significantly more in boys than in girls, seizures/seizure-like behaviours as presenting significantly more in girls. It is likely that carers will more readily recognise the male-significant behaviours as autism, hence increasing the likelihood of a referral compared with that of a female.

### **3. Historical theories**

It will help to understand the male excess of autism if the historical theories surrounding the origin of autism are summarised. One of the earliest theories, expounded by Kanner himself, (the ability to rotate to focus strongly on particular stimuli), but a physical counterpart in diffuse attention and verbal intelligence (Crespi, 2016). Further, giving credence to a biological origin of autism, there are one substantial (Johnson et al., 2007). Crepsi (2016) also states that there are “significant, substantial genetically-based positive associations of autism risk with intelligence”.

Overall, the shifts in thinking surrounding autism over the last 80 years very clearly point towards a genetic basis. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of historical twin studies of autism from 1989-2014 continue to demonstrate that there is a strong heritability to autism (Tick et al., 2016). However, while this does increase the likelihood of a genetic basis for the bias, it can be concluded that the male excess of autism is entirely genetic.

### **4. Genetic Liability**

Lai et al. (2014) also seeks to provide further potential compounding factors that make male bias. These operate by changing the ‘liability threshold’: the exclusive) at which autism diagnoses in female patients less likely than male, thereby leading to an unrepresentative male bias. Routinely diagnosed. The four potential (non-mutually exclusive) models, in summary, are:

1. Multiple genetic factors increase the risk of autism, and the liability threshold for these is higher in females vs males.
    
2. Multiple sex-specific genetic or environmental factors increase the threshold being more in females / decrease the threshold in males.
    
3. Greater genetic variation in male patients leads to the threshold being more easily met in males (although exceeded to a greater extent in females).
    

Lai et al. (2014) also adds onto the idea of variation in particular traits than females do: a collection of genetic and environmental factors aforementioned ‘liability threshold’: do a collection of genetic and environmental factors males show a greater variety in genotype, there is a greater chance that enough genetic factors accumulate to exceed the liability threshold. Furthermore, a key aspect of this is the fact that females generally present more severe autism, for example IQs, more social deficiencies, and less play ability. Additionally, males for more commonly presents itself in affected females generally have to be attributed as less play ability. Additionally, males for more commonly presents itself in more first-degree relatives than in females). This shows a greater genetic penetrance) (Tsai & Beisler, 1983).

### **5. Syndromic Genetic Factors**

Two types of genetic factors will be discussed when looking at the biological factors behind autism - syndromic and non-syndromic (both of which are heritable). Syndromic factors underpins cases where a single mutation can be specialised as the root cause of the autistic symptoms. This is similar to conditions such as sickle-cell anaemia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Non-syndromic factors can accumulate and lead to an increased risk of an individual developing autism, but cannot be attributed as a single-mutation clear in the same way as syndromic genes.

One of the first clear examples of a pathogenic mutation that was strongly correlated with autism was NLGN4, a protein in the Neuroligin family (Jamain et al., 2003). Following formation of synaptic junctions in the developing embryo, these play a critical part in maturing the synapses and forming vital presynaptic specialisations. Knockout experiments show that a complete lack of NLGNs expression leads to an unviable embryo. These are present on polymorphic synaptic receptors (Südhof, 2008).

With regards to a ‘male excess’, Jamain et al. (2003) observed that NLGN4 is on the X-chromosome, and loss-of-function (de novo mutations in a mother but not to be associated with 2 affected sons (de novo, another with Asperger’s) were found to be associated with 2 affected sons. On the same paper in a 3rd, a missense mutation via an affected mother, also found on the X-chromosome, in one another family where an affected mother, also found on the X-chromosome, in one another family where an affected mother, also found on the X-chromosome, in one another family where an affected mother, also found on the X-chromosome, in one another family via cytosine deamination to a family where an affected mother.

2. “The point mutations in NLGN3 and NLGN4 cause severe alterations of the predicted protein structure”.
    
3. There are, however, issues with using these to back-up an individual’s excess for autism. This based on NLGN3/4 mutations - with the first, Jamain et al. (2003) cites Thomas et al. (1999) based paper 8 cases, where only 3 with a deletion or translocation in Xp22.3 show symptoms similar to autism. Thomas et al. (1999) also states that ‘Genes on the X chromosome do not account for a substantial part of the genetic susceptibility to autism’.
    

Additionally, syndromic protein may be significantly affected or deformed as a result of the deletions, this provides no causal link to the development of autism, and again works on assumptions that are not expressed or even hinted at that are not the expressed. The conclusions of this study do not claim to explain all or even a majority of autism cases from this, instead that the window of major synapse formations and maturation. This would provide the causal link between particular NLGN3/4S mutations and the development of autism - one that leads itself to a far better explanation of the biological fundamentals of autism - one that leads to a various neurologically-significant years, which is late enough to fall in the window of major synapse formations and maturation. This would provide the causal link between particular NLGN3/4S mutations and a 2-6 months from the last 10 years that was observed by Kanner (1943), and is still from in studies following the birth, something that Jones & Klin, 2013). That being said, Südhof (2008) provides a different explanation - one that lends itself to a far better explanation of the biological fundamentals of autism - one that lends to a various neurologically-significant.

proteins can lead to a presentation of various neurodivergence or neurological conditions - this can include NLGN3/4, as well as SHANK3 and NRXN1. Südhof (2008) attempts up as “hotspots for human cognitive diseases”. This would solve the ‘issue’ with these proteins can lead to a presentation of various neurodivergence or neurological conditions - to relate NLGN3/4 mutations directly with autism, as this idea can other neurological conditions - Südhof (2008) akin to typical autism, but can also lead to often present themselves with symptoms akin to typical autism, but can also lead to schizophrenia.

While taking into account the conclusions of both Südhof and Jamain et al. (2003), it is still difficult to conclude that this can be the fundamental basis of male bias in autism. It is therefore necessary to look further into other factors that could underpin a male bias in autism.

### **6. Common genetic variants associated with autism**

There are a number of loci found that are shown to significantly contribute to autism heritability without being syndromic factors. 5 of these are found exclusively in autism, with another 7 linked additionally to either depression, schizophrenia, or high academic female.

attainment (Grove et al., 2019). These were identified in a genome-wide association study, which uses single nucleotide polymorphisms to identify genes associated with particular conditions (Bush, 2019). All of these are autosomal, and so do not provide any evidence for a male excess by themselves. Page 12 / 27 that me has a + potential for any male patient to accumulate multiple of these mutations compared with female patients does lend.

The common genetic variants that are associated with both autism and schizophrenia include KMT2E, which has been implicated in a cell cycle, chromatin and genomic regulation. Critically, KMT2E is “a major risk factor for a more severe and therefore more easily recognizable form of schizophrenia,” leading to a male:female excess of around ~1.4:1 (Aleman et al., 2003). This leads further credence to the idea that there is a heightened risk factor surrounding being male and presenting more severe psychological conditions. KMT2E is not the only one that is implicated in both autism and schizophrenia development, and often towards the beginning of research into autism, physicians would struggle for a and often towards the beginning of research into autism, physicians would struggle for a ‘shared phenotype’ between childhood schizophrenia and autism are those associated with depression and high academic attainment. The latter has been shown a time to again to explain for the male excess, as intelligence has been shown a significant issue and a genetic explanation for the male excess, as intelligence has been shown a significant issue and a genetic explanation for the difference between the sexes (Halpern & Wai, 2020). An example of this is the gene.

Overall, there are multiple genes that have a significant causal role in the development of autism diagnoses. It is clear that the potential for the male role for androgens in on specific genes, there is clear evidence for a potential genetic role for the male excess in autism diagnoses. However, evidence for using this as the sole reason for the excess, and it is therefore necessary to examine non-genetic factors that may play a role in this.

### **7. Non-genetic factors behind autism**

Looking back to Kanner (1945)’s original findings, the parents of his original 11 were presented as introverted, intelligent, and generally more interested in material or intellectual pursuits than social engagement. They be considered as definitive with the following caveats that they have noted that his findings need to be an being.

2. Parental feelings about the diagnosed issues ‘rebuffed or coldly’ or similar, confirming the parents presumptions
    
3. Parental behaviour can be due to the diagnosed issues react coldly’ or similar, confirming
    

Additionally, while Kanner’s original findings are invaluable, it should be noted that his observations of the parents were from what they are today. It is difficult therefore to draw any immediate conclusions from the families, and their potential cultural influences on the diagnosis of autism.

Socioeconomic differences have continued to have an impact on the diagnosis of autism. There is a general connection between higher socioeconomic backgrounds and access to/trust in healthcare, leading to those in generally lower socioeconomic backgrounds to be less likely to seek out a diagnosis (Cookson et al., 2016). This is the fact that autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and requires an in-depth diagnosis by a specialist. It is very possible that new or uneducated parents may simply believe a even be that parents are unaware of autism itself, significantly decreasing the chance of a positive diagnosis. Furthermore, as the UK is an incredibly diverse country, there are some communities and psychiatric medicine, giving another compounding factor (Bernier et al., 2010). However, while these socioeconomic differences do have an impact by potentially decreasing the overall number of autism diagnoses, it is difficult to say they have a greater impact on decreasing female diagnoses.

---

### **8. Female-specific non-genetic factors**

There are additional issues that compromise potential diagnoses in females specifically. One of these is ‘masking’ - deliberate behaviours designed to appear more in line with their peers. This may be common to the “Female Protective Effect” (Wing et al., 2022). Appearing different or acting weirdly amongst other childcry is a very common behaviour exhibited by children (van Schaik & Hunnius, 2016), and is not limited to childhood or it is not surprising that deliberate actions are taken by autistic females in in addition, abnormally large amount of time and energy and that of males of a similar age. One example of this may appear to be intense interests, where a particular hobby receives an abnormally large amount of time and energy from the individual. The National Autistic Society (2020) states “Many autistic people have intense and highly-focused interests, often from a fairly young age. These can change over time or be lifelong. It can be music, gardening, animals, postcodes or cartoon characters.” In many girls, children it’s then seen as more standard or particular cartoon characters.” In many girls, children it’s then seen as more standard or particular than boys, and so is less likely to lead to an autism referral. The special interests can often be the intensity of such interests is seen amongst neurotypical teenage girls. The intensity of such interests is seen amongst neurotypical teenage girls. The intensity of such interests may be greater, which is often seen amongst neurotypical teenage girls. The intensity of such interests may be greater, which is & Ashton-Smith, 2011). Despite this has led to many cases of females only being diagnosed with autism in adulthood, despite recalling symptoms that line up with autism from childhood (Bargiela et. al., 2016).

There is a critical’ issue, which modern literature has a far more experience and analysis on autism caused by a different psychological condition. However, as mentioned in the introduction, modern literature has a far more experience and analysis on autism caused by a different psychological condition. However, as mentioned in the introduction, modern literature has a far more experience and analysis on autism caused by a different psychological condition.

However, as mentioned in the introduction, modern literature has a far more experience and analysis on autism caused by a different psychological condition. It is similar to the vast majority of developmental and psychological conditions.

### **9. The broad spectrum of autism**

Part of the broad spectrum of autism is where it overlaps with other neurodevelopmental or psychological conditions. As previously mentioned, this includes ADHD, bipolar disorder, and majorly depressive disorder (Morimoto et. al., 2021). Can also include of all of the-above (Psychodrism Showed the Chronic Genomics Consortium-wide single-nucleotide Polymorphism Group 4 which were significantly implicated in of all of the-above (Psychodrism showed 4 loci which were significantly implicated in all of the-above (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013). It is clear, therefore, that there is no lack of genetic diagnoses in neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, and that any significant shift in variation towards a particular group must be at least partly genetic.

### **10. Weighing up the factors**

As numerous genetic and non-genetic factors have been discussed that may or may not contribute to the male excess seen in autism diagnoses, it is important to weigh them up to consider whether the excess can be due to entirely genetic factors. While non-genetic factors may not play a role, it may be insignificant enough that the excess would still exist if they were not present. Table 1 below summarises the genetic and non-genetic factors respectively:

|Genetic Factors|Non-Genetic Factors|
|---|---|
|Autism is a genetic condition and is a ‘genetic liability threshold’ to present autism than females do|Identifying and diagnosing autism is based on traits presented and more males than in females|
|X-linked neurogilins show a strong correlation with syndromic autism|Females are better at ‘masking’ the traits of autism, leading to a decrease in diagnoses|
|Males show higher rate of genetic _de novo_ mutation, leading to a greater chance of behaviours considered atypical|Autistic behaviours in girls are generally considered less atypical than autistic behaviours in boys|
|Autism is linked to schizophrenia, which also shows a self-fulfilling excess in diagnoses|Studies on autism have largely been performed on a male group, leading to a self-fulfilling excess in diagnoses|
|Androgens (particularly testosterone) are shown to increase presentation of autistic traits||
