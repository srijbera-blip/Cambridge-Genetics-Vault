TFIIA (Transcription Factor II A) is one of the **general (basal) transcription factors (GTFs)** essential for accurate transcription initiation by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotes

.

Here's a comprehensive description of TFIIA:

• **Role in Pre-initiation Complex Assembly**:

   TFIIA plays a role in the **assembly of the [[pre-initiation complex]] (PIC)** at the core promoter

. The PIC is a multi-protein complex that includes RNA Polymerase II and other general transcription factors, all necessary for transcription initiation

.

    ◦ Specifically, TFIIA **binds to and stabilizes the interaction of TFIID with DNA**

. TFIID is another crucial GTF, composed of TBP and TAFs, which initially binds to the promoter to nucleate the assembly of other GTFs

.

• **Components**:

    ◦ In humans, TFIIA is composed of **three subunits**

.

• **Context within General Transcription Factors**:

    ◦ Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II, Pol I, and Pol III cannot effectively initiate transcription alone and require additional accessory factors

. These factors are categorized as either general (basal) factors or sequence-specific DNA-binding regulatory proteins. TFIIA falls into the **general factors category**

.

    ◦ General factors, including TFIIA, are usually **specific for one RNA Polymerase** (Pol I, II, or III)

.

In summary, TFIIA's primary function is to support the stability of the TFIID-DNA interaction, thereby contributing to the nucleation and stabilization of the entire pre-initiation complex required for RNA Polymerase II activity.
