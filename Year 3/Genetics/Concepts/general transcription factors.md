- a class of regulatory proteins that play a crucial role in initiating transcription in eukaryotic cells. 
- unlike sequence-specific transcription factors, gtfs do not directly bind t distal enhancers but instead bind to core promoters, which are DNA regulatory sequences that surround transcription start sites


### role in transcription initiation
- gtfs essential for recruiting rna polyermase II to a genes transcription start site
- work in conjunction with other transcription factors and [[Coregulator]]s to control the accessibility of DNA to RNA polymerase II, allowing transcription to begin

### interaction with [[Coregulator]]s and enhancers
- GTFs can bind directly to DNA regulatory sequences within core promoters
- TFs that bind to distal and proximal enhancers often physically interact with coactivators such as TFIID and mediator, which in turn recruit RNA polyemerase II to the transcription start site
- recruitment and access to DNA of GTFs and RNA polymerase II are controlled by coregulators which bind to transcription factors



### **Examples and Components**:

    ◦ **TFIID** is a general transcription factor complex mentioned in the context of histone modifications. Its TAF1 subunit contains a bromodomain that can bind to acetylated histones, increasing its affinity for particular genes

. TFIID recruits RNA polymerase II to the promoter

.

    ◦ Another component, **TBP (TATA-binding protein)**, which is part of the TFIID complex, directly binds the TATA promoter element

.

###  **Relationship with Chromatin Structure and Modifications**:

    ◦ The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin can restrict access of the transcription machinery, including GTFs, to DNA

.

    ◦ **Histone modifications aid in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex**, which includes GTFs. For example, acetylated histones (H3K9ac and H3K14ac) serve as binding sites for TAF1 bromodomains, thereby recruiting the TFIID complex

.

    ◦ Chromatin remodeling complexes, such as SWI/SNF, work to mobilize nucleosomes and reposition them to create nucleosome-depleted regions where transcription factors bind and **RNA Polymerase II initiates transcription**

. This remodeling allows GTFs and RNA polymerase II greater access to the DNA

.

    ◦ The "histone code hypothesis" suggests that different combinations of histone modifications create unique binding sites that can be read by transcription coregulators, which then influence the variety of transcriptional outcomes, including the actions of GTFs

.

### **Distinction from Sequence-Specific Transcription Factors**:

    ◦ While many toolkit genes (genes important for development) encode **transcription factors** that directly regulate the expression of other genes, or are components of signal-transduction pathways

, GTFs are distinct as they focus on the fundamental machinery of transcription initiation rather than specific gene activation or repression based on DNA sequence recognition beyond the core promoter

.






In essence, GTFs are the fundamental components of the transcription machinery that ensure RNA polymerase II is correctly positioned to begin the process of gene expression in eukaryotes, often facilitated and regulated by other transcription factors and chromatin modifications
