The **RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC)** is a crucial molecular machine involved in gene regulation, particularly in mediating gene silencing

.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about RISC:

• **Composition**

    ◦ The RISC complex is formed when a **small RNA** (either a small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a microRNA (miRNA)) **binds to Argonaute (Ago) proteins**

.

    ◦ Specifically, **siRNA bound by an Argonaute protein is referred to as the RISC complex**

.

    ◦ In the case of single-stranded miRNAs, they associate with Argonaute proteins and "other proteins" to form RISC

.

• **Function and Mechanism**

    ◦ RISC mediates gene silencing by **degrading native messenger RNA (mRNA)** that is complementary to the bound small RNA

.

    ◦ The **Argonaute protein within the RISC complex possesses "slicing" activity**, meaning it can cut the target RNA at the binding site, leading to its subsequent degradation

.

    ◦ For miRNAs, RISC also functions by **inhibiting translation and destabilizing target mRNAs** through imperfect base-pairing

.

    ◦ This action results in a complete or significant reduction of mRNA levels, effectively nullifying the expression of that gene

.

• **Role and Significance**

    ◦ RISC is central to the process of **RNA interference (RNAi)**, a powerful cellular mechanism for inactivating specific genes

.

    ◦ It is **found in most eukaryotes**

.

    ◦ miRNAs, functioning through RISC, are **essential for animal and plant development**, regulating a large percentage of human genes

.

    ◦ RNAi, involving RISC, is also important in **antiviral immunity** by destroying the genomes of RNA viruses during replication

.

    ◦ The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) by Andy Fire and Craig Mello, which involves the RISC complex, was recognized with a Nobel Prize

.

    ◦ Beyond its biological roles, RNAi is a valuable experimental tool and holds promise for new therapeutic approaches

.

• **Processing of small RNAs that associate with RISC**

    ◦ **MicroRNAs (miRNAs)** are typically transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) as primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs)

. These are then processed by the RNases Drosha and Dicer into mature, short (~22 nucleotide) single-stranded miRNAs, which are subsequently bound by Argonaute proteins to form RISC

.

    ◦ **Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)** are generated when long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed by the enzyme Dicer into short (~23 nucleotide) siRNAs. These siRNAs are then bound by Argonaute proteins to form the RISC complex
