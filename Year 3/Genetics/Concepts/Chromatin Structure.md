### Definition
> Chromatin is the substance within a eukaryotic nucleus, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. It serves to highly compact the DNA to fit within the nucleus while also playing a critical role in regulating gene expression by controlling the accessibility of DNA to transcription machinery. 

### Context & Significance
> Chromatin solves the fundamental problem of packaging an enormous amount of DNA (in humans, about 2 meters) into a microscopic nucleus.  Beyond simple compaction, its dynamic structure acts as a primary layer of gene regulation in eukaryotes. Whether a gene is transcriptionally active or silent is largely determined by whether its associated chromatin is in an "open" (euchromatin) or "closed" (heterochromatin) state. This is a key difference from bacteria, where DNA is more readily accessible. 

### Mechanisms / Key Details
> The structure of chromatin is organised into several hierarchical levels of folding:
> - **Nucleosomes (The Basic Unit):** The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. [cite: 4089, 4163] [cite_start]It consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapping approximately 1.7 times around a central protein complex called a histone octamer. [cite: 4163] [cite_start]This structure is often described as "beads on a string" and results in a fiber ~11 nm in diameter. [cite: 4179]
> [cite_start]- **Histones:** There are five main types of these small, positively charged proteins. [cite: 4092, 4108] [cite_start]Four **core histones** (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form the octamer (two of each). [cite: 4093, 4163] [cite_start]The fifth, **linker histone** H1, binds to the DNA between nucleosomes and helps with further compaction. [cite: 4094, 4168]
> [cite_start]- **30-nm Fiber:** Nucleosomes fold upon themselves, likely through interactions involving histone H1 and the flexible tails of the core histones, to form a more compact filament ~30 nm in diameter. [cite: 4182, 4198]
> - **Higher-Order Structures (Euchromatin vs. Heterochromatin):**
>     [cite_start]- **Euchromatin** is a less compacted state of chromatin that is generally associated with transcriptionally active genes. [cite: 4205, 4215]
>     [cite_start]- **Heterochromatin** is a much more highly compacted state, associated with transcriptional silencing. [cite: 4205, 4215] [cite_start]It is often found in gene-poor regions like centromeres and telomeres (**constitutive heterochromatin**) or in gene-rich regions that are dynamically silenced (**facultative heterochromatin**). [cite: 4212, 4213]

### Role in regulating transcription
#### II. [[Chromatin Structure]] (LO 12.2)

- **A. Packaging of DNA:** DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form chromatin, compacting DNA ~10,000-fold.
- **B. Histones:Types:** H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4.
- **Core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4):** Form the core complex of nucleosomes. Highly abundant, small, basic, positively charged proteins (lysine, arginine rich). Highly conserved in evolution.
- **Structural domains:** Histone folds (central, form α-helices, critical for H2A/H2B and H3/H4 pairing), histone-fold extensions, flexible tails (unstructured, interact with non-histone proteins and nucleosomes).
- **Linker histone (H1):** Binds linker DNA between nucleosomes. Larger, more diverse than core histones.
- **Variant histones:** Replace canonical histones in nucleosomes (e.g., H2A-Z at promoters, H2A-X at DNA damage sites).
- **C. Nucleosomes:Basic structural units of chromatin.**
- Contain 146 bp of DNA wrapped ~1.7 times around a histone octamer (2 copies of H2A, H2B, H3, H4).
- Stability due to protein-protein and histone-DNA interactions.
- Flexible tails extend from DNA.
- **Assembly/Disassembly:** H3/H4 tetramer first, then H2A/H2B dimers. Reverse for removal. H1 binding organizes linker DNA.
- **D. Chromatin Folding:11 nm fiber:** DNA wrapped around histone octamers (~6-fold compaction).
- **30 nm fiber:** Nucleosomes fold upon themselves.
- **Higher-order compaction:** Leads to extreme compaction in eukaryotic cells.
- **Heterochromatin:** More compacted, gene-poor regions (e.g., centromeres, telomeres). Transcriptionally silent.
- **Constitutive heterochromatin:** Remains heterochromatic throughout cell cycle.
- **Facultative heterochromatin:** Can lose compact structure and become euchromatin.
- **Euchromatin:** Less compacted, gene-rich regions. Transcriptionally active.
- **E. Nucleosome Distribution and Organization:Nucleosome Free Regions (NFRs):** Often found at transcription start sites and enhancers of active genes, flanked by positioned nucleosomes (-1 and +1 nucleosomes).
- **Topologically Associating Domains (TADs):** Regions of chromatin that preferentially contact one another, defined by insulator elements bound by proteins like CTCF. Limit enhancer-promoter interactions to within a TAD.

#### III. Chromatin Regulates Transcription (LO 12.3)

- **A. Mechanisms for Dynamic DNA Access:** Eukaryotic genes are generally inaccessible and silent unless activated.
- **Chromatin modification:** Enzymes alter chemical structure of histones or DNA.
- **Chromatin remodeling:** Enzymes use ATP hydrolysis to reposition, remove, or replace nucleosomes.
- **B. Histone Modification:Post-translational modifications:** Occur after protein translation.
- **Acetylation (of lysine):Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs):** Add acetyl groups, neutralizing positive charge of lysine. Reduces chromatin compaction, increases DNA accessibility, promotes transcription (e.g., GCN5).
- **Histone Deacetylases (HDACs):** Remove acetyl groups, increasing chromatin compaction, reducing DNA accessibility, promoting repression.
- **Mechanisms of Acetylation Effect:** Loosens histone-DNA/nucleosome-nucleosome interactions; creates binding sites for bromodomains (reader proteins, e.g., TAF1 subunit of TFIID).
- **Other Histone Modifications:** Methylation (lysine, arginine), phosphorylation (serine, threonine, tyrosine), ubiquitination (lysine).
- **Writers:** Add modifications (e.g., Histone Methyltransferases - HMTs).
- **Erasers:** Remove modifications (e.g., Histone Demethylases - HDMs, phosphatases).
- **Readers:** Bind modifications (e.g., bromodomains, chromodomains, PHD fingers, 14-3-3 proteins, methyl binding domain proteins).
- **Histone Code Hypothesis:** Proposes that multiple histone modifications, acting sequentially or in combination, specify unique transcription outcomes. (e.g., H3K4me3 at active promoters, H3K9me3 at repressed promoters).
- **C. DNA Modification:5-methylcytosine (5mC):** Predominant DNA modification in vertebrates (at CpG dinucleotides).
- **DNA Methyltransferases (DNMTs):** Add methyl groups.
- **TET enzymes:** Reverse methylation.
- **CpG islands:** Clusters of unmethylated CpGs, often in gene promoters, correlated with open chromatin and active transcription.
- **Effect on Transcription:** Methylated CpGs repress transcription by interfering with TF binding and serving as binding sites for Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) proteins, which recruit repressors like HDACs or HMTs (producing H3K9me3).
- **D. Chromatin Remodeling:ATP-dependent complexes:** Use ATP hydrolysis to change histone-DNA interactions.
- **Mechanisms:** Slide nucleosomes, eject histone octamers, remove parts of octamers (e.g., H2A/H2B dimers), or replace canonical histones with variants.
- **SWI/SNF complex:** An example, remodels nucleosomes by removing H2A/H2B dimers then the rest of the octamer. Recruited by TFs and acetylated histones (via bromodomain-containing subunit).
- **SWR1 complex:** Exchanges H2A-Z/H2B dimers for H2A/H2B dimers. Targets enhancers/promoters, leads to increased DNA accessibility.
- **E. Connecting Chromatin Structure to Transcription (IFN-β gene example):**Viral infection activates IFN-β gene.
- Transcription factors bind proximal enhancer, forming an enhanceosome.
- HATs (GCN5) and kinases recruited, acetylating H4K8, H3K9, and phosphorylating H3S10. These modifications occur _before_ transcription.
- Crosstalk: H3S10P required for GCN5 to acetylate H3K14.
- TFIID (contains bromodomains) binds acetylated histones. SWI/SNF complex recruited.
- TFIID recruits RNA polymerase II, SWI/SNF remodels nucleosomes.
- Activating marks removed by HDACs and phosphatases to turn off transcription.
- **Overall Model:** DNA regulatory sequences (enhancers, promoters, insulators), histone code, and DNA modifications provide information. Reader proteins bind this information, recruiting enzymes that edit information or change chromatin structure, altering DNA accessibility for transcription machinery.

#### IV. Chromatin in Epigenetic Regulation (LO 12.4)

- **A. Epigenetic Inheritance:** Heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype without altering the DNA sequence. Chromatin structure (histone/DNA modifications) is inherited through cell divisions.
- **B. Cellular Memory:**Cellular differentiation results in stable, inherited transcription patterns.
- **Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins:** Maintain repressed transcription states (e.g., trimethylate H3K27).
- **Trithorax Group (TrxG) proteins:** Maintain active transcription states (e.g., acetylate H3K27).
- **Targeting:** Influenced by TFs, histone modifications, DNA methylation, lncRNAs.
- **C. Position-Effect Variegation (PEV):**Expression of a gene is silenced when relocated near heterochromatin (e.g., _white_ gene in _Drosophila_).
- Causes patchy phenotype due to mosaic silencing.
- Demonstrates heritability of chromatin structure and its effect on gene expression.
- **Genetic screens for PEV modifiers:Suppressor of variegation (Su(var)):** Reduces heterochromatin spread; wild-type product required for spreading (e.g., HP1, Su(var)3-9).
- **Enhancer of variegation (E(var)):** Increases heterochromatin spread; wild-type product normally blocks spreading.
- **Mechanism:** HP1 (chromodomain binds H3K9me3) and Su(var)3-9 (HMT, trimethylates H3K9) form a feed-forward loop to spread heterochromatin.
- **Boundary/Insulator elements:** Prevent heterochromatin spreading by recruiting activating enzymes or blocking histone access.
- **D. Genomic Imprinting:**Autosomal genes expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner (e.g., _Igf2_ from paternal allele, _H19_ from maternal allele).
- No DNA sequence change, but differential epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone modifications) at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs).
- **Example (_Igf2_/_H19_ cluster):Male germ cells:** ICR methylated. CTCF cannot bind. Enhancer activates _Igf2_. Methylation extends into _H19_ promoter, silencing it.
- **Female germ cells:** ICR unmethylated. CTCF binds, acting as insulator, blocking _Igf2_ activation. Enhancer activates _H19_.
- Epigenetic marks established in germ cells and maintained through development.
- **E. X-Chromosome Inactivation (X-inactivation / Dosage Compensation):**In mammals, one of two X chromosomes in females is transcriptionally silenced to balance gene dosage with males.
- Inactive X forms a Barr body (highly condensed heterochromatin).
- Random choice of inactivation, maintained throughout cell divisions.
- **Mechanism:Xist (X-inactive specific transcript):** 17-kb long noncoding RNA (lncRNA).
- **Tsix:** Antisense transcript of Xist.
- Early development: Tsix expressed from both X chromosomes.
- X-chromosome pairing represses Tsix on one allele (future Xi).
- Xist lncRNA expressed from future Xi, spreads along it (nucleated by YY1 protein).
- Xist recruits PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), which catalyzes H3K27me3 (heterochromatin associated).
- Other modifications: H3K9 methylation, histone deacetylation, DNA CpG island methylation, macroH2A incorporation.
- **Drosophila dosage compensation:** X chromosome transcription upregulated twofold in males, involving lncRNAs (roX1, roX2) and chromatin alterations (H4K16ac, H3S10P, nucleosome remodeling).

### Open Questions & Critiques
> The precise structure of the 30-nm fiber and even higher levels of folding in the living cell are still areas of active research and debate. The exact mechanisms by which chromatin states are propagated through cell division (epigenetic inheritance) are also being investigated intensively.
