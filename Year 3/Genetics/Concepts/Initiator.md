The **Initiator (Inr)** is a crucial component of eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II promoters

.

Here's what the sources indicate about the Initiator:

• **Nature and Sequence:** It is a **short, conserved DNA sequence**, often characterized by the motif **Py2CAPy5**, where Py represents a pyrimidine (cytosine or thymine)

.

• **Location:** The Initiator is found precisely **at the transcription start point (+1)** of many RNA Polymerase II promoters

.

• **Promoter Element:** It is a common element within the **core promoter** for RNA Polymerase II genes, frequently appearing alongside a TATA box or a Downstream Promoter Element (DPE)

. For instance, a core promoter often includes either an Initiator and a TATA box, or an Initiator and a DPE
