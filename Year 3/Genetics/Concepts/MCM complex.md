### Definition
> The **MCM (Minichromosome Maintenance) Complex** is a core DNA helicase essential for unwinding the DNA double helix during the initiation and elongation phases of [[DNA replication]] in eukaryotes.

### Context & Significance
The MCM complex is a fundamental component of the machinery that ensures a cell's genome is duplicated accurately and only once per cell cycle. [cite_start]In yeast, the transcription factor **[[MCM1]]** plays a key role in regulating cell-type specific genes involved in mating[cite: 2278, 2281]. While it shares part of its name, the MCM1 transcription factor's role in gene regulation is distinct from the MCM2-7 complex's direct role in DNA replication.

### Structure
[cite_start]The functional MCM complex is a **heterohexamer**, meaning it is composed of six different but related protein subunits that assemble into a ring structure[cite: 1779]. These six core subunits are:
- [[MCM2]]
- [[MCM3]]
- [[MCM4]]
- [[MCM5]]
- [[MCM6]]
- [[MCM7]]

### Function & Mechanism
The primary role of the MCM complex is to function as the catalytic core of the **replicative helicase**. Its job is to unwind the parental DNA duplex, creating the single-stranded templates required by [[DNA Polymerase]].

The loading and activation of the MCM complex is a critical, highly-regulated process that defines the **origin of replication** and commits the cell to a round of DNA synthesis. This process prevents the DNA from being replicated more than once in a single cell cycle.
