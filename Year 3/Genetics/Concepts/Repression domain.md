Definition

A **repression domain** is a specific functional region within a transcription factor protein that is responsible for **turning off or reducing the rate of gene transcription**

. All transcription factors contain either an activation domain or a combined activation/repression domain

part of a [[repressor]]
.

Context & Significance

The repression domain plays a critical role in the intricate and more complex regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells, in contrast to the simpler mechanisms often seen in bacteria

. It helps to **precisely control gene expression** by restricting the access of RNA polymerases to gene promoters. This is particularly important because eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin, which generally renders DNA inaccessible and genes transcriptionally silent unless actively turned on or off. Repression domains are integral to establishing and maintaining **gene-specific transcriptional silencing** in response to various cellular or environmental signals

.

Mechanisms / Key Details

Repression domains primarily function by:

• **Recruiting corepressor proteins**: They physically interact with and recruit **corepressors**, which do not directly bind DNA themselves but decrease the amount of transcription

.

• **Modifying chromatin structure**: Once recruited, corepressors can enzymatically modify other transcription regulatory factors

, often leading to changes in chromatin structure that impede transcription machinery access: 
> - **Histone deacetylation**: Corepressors can recruit **histone deacetylases (HDACs)**, which remove acetyl groups from lysines in histones. This action increases chromatin compaction and reduces accessibility of the transcription machinery to DNA, thereby promoting transcription repression.
> - **Histone methylation**: Repression can also be achieved by recruiting histone methyltransferases (HMTs) that produce specific histone modifications, such as **H3K9me3**, which serves as a binding site for corepressors like heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that promote heterochromatin formation and repress transcription. Polycomb group proteins, for instance, maintain a repressed state by trimethylating H3K27. 
> - **DNA methylation**: Repression domains, via recruited corepressors, can also be connected to **DNA methylation** (e.g., at CpG islands). Methylation of CpGs can repress transcription by directly interfering with transcription factor binding to enhancers and by serving as a binding site for methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins that recruit transcription repressors like HDACs or HMTs. 
> - **Chromatin remodeling**: Some ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are associated with transcription repression, altering nucleosome position or removal to reduce DNA accessibility

.

• **Blocking activation domain activity**: In some cases, corepressors directly bind to and inhibit the activity of an activation domain within the same or a different transcription factor

. For example, Gal80 acts as a corepressor of Gal4 by binding within Gal4's activation domain, blocking its ability to promote transcription until released by Gal3 in the presence of galactose

.

• **Modular function**: Like activation domains, repression domains are **modular**, meaning they can function independently of other domains like the DNA-binding domain

. This modularity highlights their distinct functional role.

Open Questions & Critiques

The sources highlight the function and modularity of repression domains and their interactions with corepressors and chromatin modifiers. While the general mechanisms are well-understood, the vast "information content" of histone modifications and DNA modifications suggests that the precise ways in which different combinations of these modifications lead to specific repressive outcomes (the "histone code") are still being deciphered

. The exact interplay and sequential actions of various corepressors and chromatin-modifying enzymes recruited by repression domains, and how this is fine-tuned to achieve specific levels of repression, remains an active area of research.
