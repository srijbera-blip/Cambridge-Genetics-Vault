The Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are a class of multiprotein complexes involved in **maintaining the cellular memory of gene expression** through many rounds of cell division. They function in **opposition to Polycomb group proteins**, with Trithorax proteins maintaining genes in a **transcriptionally active state**. This ensures that once a gene's expression state (active or repressed) is set, it is maintained in daughter cells

.

Key aspects of Trithorax group proteins and their function include:

• **Mechanism of Action**

:

   Trithorax group proteins **post-translationally modify histones** and contribute to **[[Chromatin Remodeling]]**

.

   They work to **counteract [[Polycomb group (PcG)|Polycomb]]-mediated silencing** and maintain an "open" chromatin state

.

    ◦ Specific modifications include:

        ▪ **Ash1** (a TrxG protein) is a histone methyltransferase that **methylates histone H3 at Lysine 36 (H3K36)**

.

        ▪ The **Trithorax (Trx) C-terminal domain (Trx C-ter) methylates H3K4 at promoters** via its SET domain

. H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) can inhibit the activity of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)

.

        ▪ Trx C-ter directly interacts with the histone acetyltransferase **CREB-binding protein (CBP)**, and H3K4me facilitates **CBP-mediated H3K27 acetylation** (H3K27ac)

. Acetylation of lysines in histones neutralizes their positive charge, which **reduces electrostatic histone-DNA interactions and increases DNA accessibility** for other factors

.

        ▪ The **Trx N-terminal domain (Trx N-ter)** also interacts with CBP and aids in H3K27 acetylation

.

        ▪ **Fsh** (the _Drosophila_ homolog of **BRD4**) binds to acetylated lysine residues and phosphorylates the **C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II at Serine 2 (Pol II Ser2P)**, which promotes transcription elongation

. This phosphorylation may help overcome RNA Pol II pausing

.

    ◦ TrxG proteins are recruited to Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) through sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and can also be recruited by non-coding RNAs

.

    ◦ They exhibit **self-reinforcing interactions** (e.g., Ash1 enhances Trx recruitment) and **antagonistic interactions** with Polycomb group proteins

.

• **Relationship with Polycomb Response Elements (PREs)**

:

    ◦ In developmental gene regulation, an enhancer provides the initial spatial information for gene expression, typically functioning early

.

    ◦ The **Polycomb Response Element (PRE)**, which is the binding site for Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins, provides the **memory function**, maintaining the established expression pattern even in the absence of the transcription factors that initially set it

. PREs are not position-specific enhancers themselves; they ensure the pattern set by the enhancer is accurately maintained

.

• **Antagonism with Polycomb Group Proteins**

:

    ◦ Trithorax group proteins maintain an active transcriptional state, while Polycomb group proteins maintain a repressed state

.

    ◦ Histone H3K27 acetylation (Trithorax-mediated) and H3K27 trimethylation (Polycomb-mediated) are mutually exclusive modifications

. Therefore, trimethylation by Polycomb complexes blocks the activating acetylation by Trithorax complexes

.

    ◦ Trithorax-mediated methylations (H3K4me and H3K36me) inhibit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity

.

The Trithorax pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular identity during development, ensuring that specific gene expression patterns are stably inherited through cell divisions
