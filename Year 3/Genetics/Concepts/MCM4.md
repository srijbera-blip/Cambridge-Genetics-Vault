**MCM4** is one of the six ATPase subunits (MCM2-7) that constitute the **MCM2-7 complex**, which is the **replicative DNA helicase** in eukaryotic cells. This complex is essential for unwinding the DNA double helix during DNA replication, providing the single-stranded template for DNA polymerases

.

Key information regarding MCM4 from the sources includes:

• **Part of the Replicative Helicase:** MCM4, along with MCM6 and MCM7, forms a protein complex that has been specifically shown to possess **DNA helicase activity**

. This indicates its direct involvement in the unwinding function of the larger MCM2-7 complex.

• **Interaction with ESCO2:** The **ESCO2 cohesin acetyltransferase** interacts with the MCM2-7 complex, and this interaction is crucial for establishing **sister chromatid cohesion** during DNA replication

. Notably, ESCO2 has a **slight preference for interacting with MCM4** among the MCM2-7 subunits, although it may interact with multiple subunits.
