The histone code hypothesis, although now considered an outdated notion, proposed that specific combinations of histone modifications act as a "code" to determine gene expression outcomes. This information is "read" by **proteins that can bind specifically to the modified histone tails**

.

These "reader" proteins interpret the information contained in the histone modifications

. Examples of such reader proteins and the motifs they contain include:

• **Bromodomains (BD)**: Found in some transcription regulatory factors, such as the TAF1 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID, bromodomains bind to acetylated histones, increasing the affinity of the factor for particular genes

.

• **Chromodomains (CD)**: Proteins containing a chromodomain, such as Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), bind to methylated histone residues, like H3K9me3 (trimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3), which is associated with repressed transcription and promotes heterochromatin formation

.

• **PHD (plant homeodomain) fingers**: For example, the TAF3 subunit of TFIID, which contains a PHD finger, binds to H3K4me3 (trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3), activating transcription

.

• **14-3-3 proteins**: These proteins bind to phosphorylated serine 10 on histone H3 (H3S10P), which, in combination with H3K14ac, signals transcription activation

.

These reader proteins then serve as scaffolds for the assembly of enzymes that further modify histones or DNA, or change chromatin structure by repositioning nucleosomes

.

The concept of "writers," "erasers," and "readers" applies to histone modifications: writer enzymes add modifications, eraser enzymes remove them, and reader proteins interpret them by binding to them

. For instance, Histone Acetyl-Transferases (HATs) are writers, Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) are erasers, and bromodomains are readers of histone acetylation. Similarly, Histone Methyltransferases (HMTs) are writers, histone demethylases (HDMs) are erasers, and chromodomains or PHD fingers are readers of histone methylation.
