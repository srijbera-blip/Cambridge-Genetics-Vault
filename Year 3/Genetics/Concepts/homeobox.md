The **homeobox** is a specific, conserved DNA sequence, **180 base pairs (bp) in length**, found within certain genes, particularly homeotic genes like the _Hox_ genes. Its discovery led to searches for similar sequences across the animal kingdom, revealing its widespread presence

.

The homeobox encodes a protein domain called the **homeodomain**, which consists of **60 amino acids**

. This homeodomain is highly conserved in its amino acid sequence among Hox proteins, even across diverse species such as flies, mice, and fish, with some mouse and fish Hox proteins being identical to the fly homeodomain in many positions

.

Structurally, the homeodomain forms a **helix-turn-helix motif**

. This motif is well-known in other DNA-binding proteins, such as the Lac repressor and Cro proteins found in bacteria, and the α2 and a1 regulatory proteins of yeast mating-type loci

.

The relationship between the homeobox, homeodomain, and **Hox proteins** as **transcription factors** is fundamental:

• **DNA Binding:** The presence of the helix-turn-helix motif in the homeodomain strongly suggested that Hox proteins are **sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins**

. This functional prediction was later confirmed

.

• **Gene Regulation:** Hox proteins **control the expression of other genes** during development

. They achieve this by **binding to regulatory elements (enhancers) of target genes to either activate or repress their expression**. This mechanism operates on principles similar to other transcription factors

.

• **Specifying Regional Identity:** All eight _Hox_ genes in _Drosophila_ (and their homologs in other animals) encode proteins containing this homeodomain

. These genes are crucial for specifying regional identity along the antero-posterior axis of an animal, with their products acting as master regulators of downstream genes

.

Therefore, the homeodomain acts as the functional "binding site" of Hox proteins, enabling them to directly interact with DNA and control gene transcription, thereby orchestrating the developmental program that defines body plan and regional characteristics

. It's important to note that while characteristic of Hox proteins, homeodomains are also found in many other transcription factors involved in development, outside of the _Hox_ gene clusters.
