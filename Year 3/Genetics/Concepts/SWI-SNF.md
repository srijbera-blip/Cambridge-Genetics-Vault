The SWI/SNF (switch-sniff) complex is a major example of an **ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex** that plays a crucial role in regulating gene transcription

.

Here is a comprehensive overview of the SWI/SNF complexes based on the provided sources:

Function and Mechanism

The primary role of SWI/SNF is to dynamically alter chromatin structure, generally serving a **[[Coactivators|co-activator]] function** to promote transcription

.

1. **ATP Dependency:** SWI/SNF complexes utilize energy derived from **ATP hydrolysis** to disrupt non-covalent histone-DNA interactions and mobilize nucleosomes

.

2. **Remodeling Activities:** These complexes alter nucleosome structure in various ways, allowing DNA binding factors to gain access to sites on the DNA that might otherwise be blocked by nucleosomes

. These activities include:

    ◦ **Sliding nucleosomes** along the DNA fiber

.

    ◦ **Ejecting or replacing histone octamers** or parts of octamers on DNA

.

3. **Stepwise Mechanism:** Specifically, SWI/SNF affects transcription by remodeling nucleosomes in a two-step process: initially **removing an H2A/H2B dimer from DNA**, followed by the removal of the rest of the histone octamer

.

Discovery and Structure

The SWI/SNF complex was discovered through genetic screens in the simple eukaryote _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (yeast)

.

• **Genetic Screens:** The complex was named based on two seemingly unrelated mutant phenotypes observed in yeast: _snf_ (sugar non-fermenting) mutants, which lacked growth on sucrose, and _swi_ (switching) mutants, which showed defective mating type switching

.

• **Subunits:** SWI/SNF is a **large multi-subunit complex**

. The protein encoded by the **swi2/snf2** locus was found to be the **ATPase subunit** of the complex

.

• **Targeting and Specificity:** The gene specificity of SWI/SNF is regulated by binding mechanisms

. For instance, it can achieve specificity by **binding to transcription factors such as Gal4**. It is also targeted through the **binding of a bromodomain-containing subunit of the complex to acetylated lysine**. This highlights that SWI/SNF functions in concert with transcription factors and histone modifying enzymes

.

Roles in Transcription Regulation

SWI/SNF complexes are vital for enabling the transcription machinery to access DNA by creating **open chromatin** environments

.

• **General Recruitment:** Chromatin modifications, such as acetylation, recruit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes like SWI/SNF, which **change factor accessibility to DNA**

.

• **Insulator Function:** SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers may be among the activating enzymes recruited by insulator-binding proteins to **block the spread of heterochromatin**

.

• **IFN-β** **Gene Activation:** In the well-characterized human _interferon-beta_ (_IFN-β_) gene, SWI/SNF is recruited to the promoter region by **binding to H4K8ac** and through **interactions with the HAT protein CBP** (CREB-binding proteins)

. The SWI/SNF complex then **remodels nucleosomes** to allow RNA Polymerase II to initiate transcription, demonstrating how histone modifications aid the assembly of chromatin remodeling factors

.

Clinical Significance

The function of SWI/SNF is often implicated in disease states:

• **Cancer:** Subunits of the SWI/SNF complex are **mutated in >20% of human cancers** and are considered likely causal in a number of tumor types
