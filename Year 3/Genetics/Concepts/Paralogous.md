a type of homologous genes.
these genes arise from a gene duplication event within the same genome.
The term **paralogous** refers to genes that were created by a duplication event, regardless of whether the duplicated copy ended up on the **same chromosome** or a **different one**. The key is that they originated from a single ancestral gene within the same species' genome.
