Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is

==a rare, inherited skin disorder belonging to a group of genetic conditions called Epidermolysis bullosa (EB)==. 

Key features

- **Fragile skin:** The hallmark of EBS is extremely fragile skin that blisters easily from minor friction or trauma.
- **Blistering:** Blisters typically form in the top layer of the skin (epidermis).
- **Location:** Blisters frequently appear on the hands and feet but can affect other areas, including mucous membranes like the mouth and throat.
- **Severity:** EBS can range from mild (blistering limited to hands and feet, particularly in warm weather) to severe (widespread, potentially life-threatening blistering).
- **Inheritance:** Most cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (meaning one affected parent can pass it on) but autosomal recessive cases also exist.
- **Onset:** Symptoms often appear at birth or in early childhood, although milder forms may not be diagnosed until adulthood. 

Types of EBS

There are several subtypes of EBS, including:

- **Localized EBS (Weber-Cockayne type):** The most common and generally mildest form, with blistering primarily affecting the hands and feet.
- **Intermediate EBS (Koebner type):** Involves more widespread blistering, potentially severe in infancy but often improving with age.
- **Severe EBS (Dowling-Meara EBS):** The most severe form, characterized by extensive blistering on the body and potentially within the mouth.
- **EBS with Mottled Pigmentation:** Rare subtype presenting with fragile skin at birth and later developing mottled pigmentation. 

Causes

EBS is caused by mutations in genes, typically those encoding keratin 5 or keratin 14, which are crucial proteins for skin structure. These mutations lead to faulty or missing proteins in the epidermis, making the skin fragile and prone to blistering. 

Management

There is no cure for EBS, but management focuses on:

- **Wound care:** Protecting the skin, lancing blisters, and dressing wounds to prevent infection.
- **Pain control:** Using appropriate medications as needed.
- **Preventing friction:** Avoiding activities and clothing that cause rubbing or pressure on the skin.
- **Temperature management:** Avoiding heat and humidity, which can worsen blistering. 

In general, people with EBS can learn to manage their condition well, and even those with severe forms can have a normal life expectancy if they survive infancy.
