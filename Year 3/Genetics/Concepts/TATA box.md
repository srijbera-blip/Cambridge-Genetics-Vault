The **TATA box** is a crucial **cis-acting DNA sequence** and a common component of **eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) promoters**

.

Here are its key characteristics:

• **Sequence and Nature:** It consists of an **A-T-rich octamer sequence**

.

• **Location:** The TATA box is typically located approximately **25 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcription start point (+1)**

. It can also be found around 30 bp upstream of the initiation site on many Pol II promoters

.

• **Prevalence:** It is present in about **50% of human genes**

. Promoters that lack a TATA box often contain a Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) instead. A core promoter for RNA Polymerase II frequently includes both an Initiator (Inr) and a TATA box

.

• **Binding Protein:** The **TATA-binding protein (TBP)**, which is a subunit of the multi-protein complex **TFIID**, specifically binds to the TATA box

. TBP binds in the minor groove of the DNA

.

• **Function and Mechanism:**

    ◦ TBP binding to the TATA box causes a **significant bend in the DNA**

.

    ◦ This binding is critical because TFIID then **nucleates the assembly of other general transcription factors (GTFs)**, helping to determine the location of the transcription start site

.

    ◦ TAFs (TBP-associated factors), which are part of TFIID, can bind promoter sequences and aid TFIID recruitment, particularly for Pol II promoters that lack TATA boxes

.

    ◦ **TBP is considered a "universal" transcription factor** because it is also required for transcription by RNA Polymerase I and III

.

• **Chromatin Context:** Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, generally repress transcription by inhibiting the binding of TBP (part of TFIID) to TATA boxes

. Activators can relieve this repression by influencing chromatin structure. The enhanceosome, a complex of transcription factors, assembles upstream of the TATA box promoter element for genes like human IFN-β, contributing to their activation
