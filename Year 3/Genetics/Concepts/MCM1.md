**MCM1** is a **transcription factor** that plays a **key role in regulating cell type** in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (yeast). It is notable because, unlike other mating-type specific transcription factors, **MCM1 is expressed in all three yeast cell types** (a, α, and a/α), but its function is modulated by interactions with other proteins

.

Here's a breakdown of MCM1's role in yeast mating-type regulation:

• **In 'a' cells**: MCM1 **activates the expression of structural genes** necessary for an 'a' cell by binding to enhancers associated with 'a'-specific genes

.

• **In 'α' cells**:

    ◦ The **α1 protein, an activator of α-specific transcription, binds in concert with MCM1** to enhancers that control α-specific genes

.

    ◦ The **α2 protein represses transcription of 'a'-specific genes by binding with MCM1** to enhancers located upstream of 'a'-specific genes

.

• **In 'a/α' (diploid) cells**: The function of MCM1 is further modified by its interactions with the a1 and α2 proteins

.

    ◦ The **α2 protein exists in two forms**:

        1. As an **α2–MCM1 complex that represses 'a'-specific genes**

.

        2. In a **complex with the a1 protein that represses haploid-specific genes**

. This a1-α2 complex also silences genes typically expressed in haploid cells by binding to their upstream enhancers

.

Essentially, MCM1's function is **combinatorially controlled** through its interactions with other transcription factors, allowing for the precise and context-dependent regulation of gene expression that defines the different yeast cell types
