Definition

**Coregulators** are a set of regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells that **do not directly bind DNA**

. Instead, they control the amount of transcription by binding to or enzymatically modifying other transcription regulatory factors

.

Context & Significance

In eukaryotic cells, the regulation of transcription is more complex than in bacterial cells, involving a greater variety of regulatory DNA sequence elements and protein factors, including proteins that package DNA within the nucleus

. Unlike bacteria, where transcription is often regulated by single activator or repressor proteins directly binding DNA, eukaryotes have multiple proteins and DNA sequences working together. Coregulators are crucial to this increased complexity, as they **promote or restrict access of RNA polymerases to gene promoters**, thereby playing an essential role in orchestrating the distinct patterns of gene transcription that occur in eukaryotic cells. They are fundamental to **dynamic access of the transcription machinery to DNA**, allowing for a wide range of transcription states, from silent to highly active

.

Mechanisms / Key Details

Coregulators function by interacting with **transcription factors** and the **chromatin structure** to modulate gene expression:

• **Binding [[Transcription factors]]: Some coactivators, for instance, **bridge transcription factors and RNA polymerase II**, helping to recruit RNA polymerase II to a gene's transcription start site

. Coregulators can either **increase (coactivators) or decrease (corepressors)** the amount of transcription

.

• **Altering [[Chromatin Structure]]: Many coregulators, particularly those involved in **chromatin modification** and **chromatin remodeling**, affect the packaging of DNA

. > - **Histone Modification**: Coregulators include **writer enzymes** (e.g., histone acetyltransferases, HATs, that add acetyl groups; histone methyltransferases, HMTs, that add methyl groups), **eraser enzymes** (e.g., histone deacetylases, HDACs, that remove acetyl groups; histone demethylases, HDMs, that remove methyl groups), and **reader proteins** (e.g., those containing bromodomains, chromodomains, or PHD fingers) that bind and interpret these modifications. For example, HATs loosen histone-DNA interactions and create binding sites for bromodomain-containing proteins, promoting transcription activation. HDACs repress transcription by removing these acetyl groups. > - **Chromatin Remodeling**: Some coregulators are components of **ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes** (e.g., SWI/SNF, SWR1) that change histone-DNA interactions in nucleosomes. These complexes can **slide, eject, or replace histone octamers** on DNA, or exchange variant histones for canonical ones, thereby altering DNA accessibility for transcription regulators

.

• **Coordination**: Transcription factors, histone-modifying enzymes (coregulators), and chromatin remodeling factors (coregulators) often **function in concert** to regulate transcription

. For example, a transcription factor might bind an enhancer, recruit a HAT, which acetylates histones, allowing a bromodomain-containing protein to bind, and subsequently recruit RNA polymerase II or chromatin remodeling complexes

    ◦ **Yeast GAL system**: Gal80 and Gal3 proteins regulate Gal4 transcription factor activity by controlling the function of its activation domain, illustrating how environmental signals (galactose) alter transcription factor activity through protein-protein interactions

.

    ◦ **IFN-β gene regulation**: This system exemplifies the sequential, cooperative action of transcription factors, histone modifiers (HATs like GCN5, HDACs), and chromatin remodelers (SWI/SNF) to activate and repress gene transcription in response to viral infection

.

    ◦ **Yeast Mating Type**: MCM1's function is altered by interactions with α1 and α2 proteins to achieve cell-type specific gene expression

.

    ◦ **Epigenetic Regulation**: Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins, and PRC2, are coregulators that maintain gene expression states across cell divisions by modifying histones and remodeling chromatin, contributing to cellular memory, position-effect variegation, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation

• **Contrasting Concepts**: Coregulators vs. **DNA-binding Transcription Factors** (the latter directly bind DNA, while coregulators typically do not

).

Open Questions & Critiques

While much is known about how individual histone modifications occur, the **histone code hypothesis** posits that different _combinations_ of histone modifications convey unique transcriptional outcomes

. However, current experimental methods (e.g., modification-specific antibodies, mass spectrometry) are **largely unable to detect the extent to which multiple modifications coexist on an individual histone protein**, making it challenging to fully understand the combinatorial logic of the histone code
