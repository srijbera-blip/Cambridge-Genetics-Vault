### Definition
A **transcription factors (TF)** are a series of regulatory proteins that bind to specific regulatory DNA sequences to control the transcription of individual genes.

### Core Properties
[cite_start]Transcription factors are **modular**, meaning they have several distinct functional domains that can function independently[cite: 2167, 2168, 2213]. The key domains are:
- **[[DNA-binding domain]]:** Recognises and binds to a specific DNA sequence[cite: 2085].
- **[[Activation domain]] / [[Repression domain]]:** Recruits co-regulators like [[Coactivators]] or [[Corepressors]] to increase or decrease transcription[cite: 2085].
- **[[Dimerization domain]]:** Allows TFs to form homodimers or heterodimers to bind DNA[cite: 2086]. Not all TFs have this.
- **[[Ligand-binding Domain]]:** Some TFs are activated by binding a specific molecule, like a hormone[cite: 2086].

### Function
TFs are the master switches that execute the genetic programs for cell differentiation, development, and responses to environmental signals. They work through [[Combinatorial control]] to achieve highly specific patterns of gene expression.

### Connections
- **Binds to:** [[Enhancers|Enhancer]], [[Promoters|Promoter]]
- **Regulates:** [[Gene Expression]]
- **Example:** [[Gal4]] in the [[Yeast GAL system]]
