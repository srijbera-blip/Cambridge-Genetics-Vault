The cohesin complex is a **multi-protein complex** essential for proper **chromosome dynamics** in eukaryotic cells. It plays critical roles in both **sister chromatid cohesion** and **chromosome organization** within the nucleus

.

Here's a breakdown of its composition, functions, and regulatory interactions:

• **Composition and Classification**

    ◦ Cohesins are **proteins belonging to the class of 'structural maintenance of chromosomes' proteins (SMCs)**

.

    ◦ Immunoprecipitation of the MCM2-7 complex has shown co-precipitation of all four core subunits of cohesin: **SMC1, SMC3, Rad21, and SA**

.

• **Primary Functions**

    ◦ **Sister Chromatid Cohesion**: The cohesin complex physically **tethers together sister chromatids** (the products of DNA replication) until the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mitosis. This ensures their proper alignment and accurate segregation to daughter cells, thereby maintaining **genome stability**

. In meiosis I, cohesin also links homologous chromosome pairs after crossing-over, aiding their orderly segregation

.

    ◦ **Chromosome Compaction and Folding**: Cohesin binds to chromatin and actively extrudes chromatin loops, contributing to chromosome folding and compaction

. These loops and topologically associated domains (TADs) are crucial for **proper gene regulation** by positioning promoters and enhancers in the correct topological context

.

• **Regulation and Interactions**

    ◦ **Cell Cycle Control**:

        ▪ Cohesin is largely removed from chromatin in prophase due to phosphorylation by mitotic kinases, with a small fraction protected at centromeres until anaphase

.

        ▪ In telophase, as nuclei reform, cohesin is loaded onto chromatin

.

    ◦ **Replication Licensing and MCM2-7 Complex**:

        ▪ Cohesin loading is **dependent on full replication licensing**, meaning that the assembly of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC), which includes ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM2-7 helicase, is a prerequisite

.

        ▪ The **MCM2-7 complex** (a DNA helicase) plays essential roles in cohesin regulation. It **promotes the recruitment of the cohesin loader complex** (a heterodimer of NIPBL and MAU2 proteins)

.

        ▪ The cohesin loader complex directly interacts with **Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)**, which is recruited to pre-RCs, stimulating cohesin loading

.

        ▪ Depletion of the MCM2 subunit reduces cohesin loading onto chromatin

.

        ▪ The **MCM2-7 complex also directly interacts with ESCO2** (a cohesin acetyltransferase in vertebrates)

. This interaction is critical for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during DNA replication, as ESCO2 recruits to chromatin in a pre-RC-dependent manner and acetylates the SMC3 subunit of cohesin, stabilizing its interaction with chromatin

.

        ▪ The MCM2-7 complex can also **restrict cohesin's ability to form chromatin loops** by acting as a physical barrier to loop extrusion, particularly in G1 cells

.

    ◦ **CTCF and DNA Looping**: The CTCF transcription factor interacts with cohesins ("molecular rubber bands") to enforce DNA looping and establish insulator boundaries in the genome

.

In summary, the cohesin complex acts as a vital structural and regulatory component, much like a meticulous archivist and binder for the cell's genetic library. It not only holds identical copies of genetic material (sister chromatids) together so they can be accurately divided, but also carefully folds the long DNA strands into precise loops and domains. This intricate organization, often regulated by other key molecular machines like the MCM2-7 complex and CTCF, ensures that genes are expressed correctly and the genome remains stable and functional.
