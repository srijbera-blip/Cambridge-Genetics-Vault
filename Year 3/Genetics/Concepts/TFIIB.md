TFIIB (Transcription Factor II B) is a crucial component of the **[[general transcription factors]] (GTFs)** required for RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to accurately initiate transcription in eukaryotes

.

Here are the key characteristics and functions of TFIIB:

• **Size and Structure**: TFIIB is approximately **35 kDa** in size

. It possesses an N-terminal region that interacts with RNA Pol II and upstream regulators, and the remainder of the protein is composed of two direct repeats

.

• **Role in PIC Assembly**: TFIIB acts as a **bridge between TFIID and RNA Polymerase II** within the pre-initiation complex (PIC)

. TFIID, which initially binds the promoter, nucleates the assembly of other GTFs, and TFIIB's bridging function is vital for this process

.

• **DNA Binding Specificity**: TFIIB exhibits **sequence preference for DNA binding**

. It specifically recognizes the **weakly-conserved BRE (TFIIB Recognition Element)** located just upstream of the TATA box. This binding helps to **define the transcription start site**

.

• **Interaction with Regulatory Factors**: TFIIB can be directly contacted by sequence-specific regulatory factors

. For instance, the **viral transcriptional activator VP16 binds to TFIIB**, a interaction thought to alter TFIIB's conformation and thereby assist in the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II. This demonstrates how activators can influence the activity and conformation of GTFs already assembled in the transcriptional machinery
