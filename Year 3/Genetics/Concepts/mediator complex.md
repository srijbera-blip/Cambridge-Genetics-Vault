The Mediator complex is a large, multi-polypeptide **[[Coactivators|co-activator]] complex** that plays a crucial role in [[Transcription in eukaryotes|eukaryotic transcription]] by physically and functionally interacting with RNA Polymerase II, general transcription factors, and sequence-specific transcription factors to integrate regulatory signals and facilitate transcription initiation

.

Here are the key details about the Mediator complex:

• **Composition and Conservation**

   It is an **~20 polypeptide complex** that is **well conserved from yeast to humans**

.

   It was originally identified as a set of proteins that interact physically and functionally with the **C-terminal domain (CTD) of [[RNA polymerase II]] in yeast

.

• **Function and Role in Transcription**

   The Mediator complex acts as a **[[Coactivators|co-activator]]**, bringing together general transcription factors (GTFs), RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), and transcription factors

.

   It functions to **integrate RNAPII and the assembly of transcription factors** at gene promoters

.

    ◦ Its functions can **overlap with those of TFIID**

.

    ◦ It works in conjunction with a number of activators

.

    ◦ The DNA looping mechanism, which brings distant enhancer elements into close contact with promoters, involves the Mediator complex, GTFs, and other co-activators to integrate RNAPII and transcription factor assembly

.

• **Relationship with other complexes**

    ◦ The Mediator complex has similar functions to the SAGA complex

.

In essence, you can think of the Mediator complex as a central switchboard in a bustling office. It doesn't write the reports (transcribe DNA) itself, nor does it directly decide which reports to write (gene specific sequences). Instead, it brings together the managers (transcription factors), the writers (RNA Polymerase II), and other essential staff (general transcription factors) and helps them communicate effectively, ensuring that the right reports are written at the right time and with the correct priority, based on various incoming signals.
