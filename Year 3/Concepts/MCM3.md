**MCM3** is one of the six subunits that form the **MCM2-7 complex**, which is a **hetero-hexameric ATPase subunit complex**. This MCM2-7 complex functions as the **replicative DNA helicase** in eukaryotic cells, responsible for unwinding the DNA double helix during DNA replication

.

While MCM3 is part of this larger complex, the sources provide specific details about its individual roles and interactions:

• **Interaction with Cohesin**: The cohesin complex, which is critical for chromosome organization, compaction, and segregation, is suggested to **interact directly with MCM3** in human cells

. This interaction between cohesin and MCM3 is believed to restrict cohesin's ability to form chromatin loops, acting as a physical barrier to loop extrusion, particularly in G1 cells

.

• **Role in DNA Damage Checkpoint**: MCM3 is a **direct target of the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) checkpoint kinase**

. In response to **genotoxic stress**, MCM3 becomes **phosphorylated by ATM**. This phosphorylation is part of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, which helps mediate cell cycle arrest and prevent origin firing

.

Beyond these specific roles of MCM3, the MCM2-7 complex as a whole plays several crucial functions in the nucleus:

• **DNA Replication Initiation and Control**:

    ◦ The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin at replication origins during the G1 phase, a process called **origin licensing**. This loading is an ATP-dependent step involving the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1

.

    ◦ Although loaded in G1, the MCM double hexamer is initially inactive. It becomes an **active helicase (CMG complex)** in S phase through the activity of protein kinases CDK and DDK, and the association of Cdc45 and the GINS complex

.

    ◦ After DNA replication, the CMG helicase is removed from the DNA, involving polyubiquitination of the MCM7 subunit and removal by proteins like p97/VCP/Cdc48

.

    ◦ The "MCM paradox" highlights that many more MCM2-7 complexes are loaded than are required for efficient replication, providing **robustness** to the system by allowing "dormant origins" to be activated if DNA replication is compromised

.

• **Non-Canonical Roles (beyond DNA unwinding)**: The MCM2-7 complex acts as a central hub, integrating various nuclear activities

:

    ◦ **Cohesin Regulation**: It impacts chromosome compaction and segregation by promoting the recruitment of the cohesin loader complex (NIPBL/MAU2 heterodimer) and interacting directly with the ESCO2 cohesin acetyltransferase

.

    ◦ **Transcription Coordination**: It helps mitigate transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs). The complex has been copurified with RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) holoenzyme and its expression is required for Pol II-dependent transcription

. It can be displaced by active RNA Pol II, interact with the Integrator complex to promote RNA Pol II removal from paused promoters, and unwind R-loops. Some MCM subunits (MCM5 specifically) interact with the Stat1 transcriptional activator, and the complex integrates with the transcriptional response to hypoxia

.

    ◦ **Intra-S Phase Checkpoint**: It is essential for the activation of this checkpoint when replication forks stall

. Beyond MCM3's phosphorylation by ATM, MCM2 is phosphorylated by ATR, and the complex interacts with the Fork Protection Complex (FPC) and can act as a chromatin-associated sink for inactive Chk1, facilitating its phosphorylation and release

.

    ◦ **Histone Inheritance and Epigenetic Memory**: The MCM2-7 complex contributes to chromatin reassembly by coordinating histone deposition behind the replication fork. This involves direct interaction of its MCM2 subunit with AND-1 (Ctf4 in yeast) and FACT histone chaperones, which helps recycle parental histones and maintain epigenetic marks
