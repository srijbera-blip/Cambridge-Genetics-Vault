DNA-based transposons are a class of **transposable elements**, which are DNA sequences capable of copying themselves and moving around the genome

.

Here's a detailed overview of DNA-based transposons:

• **Mechanism of Movement**: Unlike retrotransposons, which utilize an RNA intermediate, DNA-based transposons move through a **DNA-based cut-and-paste mechanism**

. This process relies on a **DNA transposon-encoded Transposase protein**

.

• **Presence in Human Genome**: DNA transposons constitute a relatively small portion of the human genome, contributing **only about 3%** of its total sequence

. They are part of the larger group of repetitive DNA elements that collectively make up over 40% of our genome

.

• **Activity in Humans**: There is **no evidence that any DNA transposons have been active in the human genome over the past 40 million years**

. Consequently, they are considered **inactive relics** in humans.
