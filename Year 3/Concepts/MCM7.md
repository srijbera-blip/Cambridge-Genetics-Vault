**MCM7** is one of the six ATPase subunits (MCM2-7) that together form the **MCM2-7 complex**, which acts as the **replicative DNA helicase** in eukaryotic cells. This complex is crucial for unwinding the DNA double helix during DNA replication

.

Here are specific details about MCM7 from the sources:

• **Helicase Activity**: MCM7, in combination with MCM4 and MCM6, forms a protein complex that has been specifically shown to possess **DNA helicase activity**

. This indicates its direct involvement in the unwinding function of the MCM2-7 complex

.

• **Role in Replisome Disassembly**: Upon completion of DNA replication, the CMG helicase (which includes MCM2-7) is **removed from the DNA**. This process involves the **polyubiquitination of the MCM7 subunit**

. In vertebrates, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL2LRR1 is responsible for this modification, and polyubiquitinated MCM7 is then recognized and removed from chromatin by the protein remodeler p97/VCP/Cdc48. MCM-binding protein (MCM-BP) and USP7 also contribute to MCM2-7 unloading, particularly from inactive origins

.

• **Interaction with ATRIP in Checkpoint Activation**: MCM7 protein interacts **directly with ATRIP**, an accessory protein of the ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinase

. Cells with reduced MCM7 expression exhibit an **intra-S phase checkpoint defect**, suggesting that MCM7 plays a critical role in activating this checkpoint through its interaction with the ATR-ATRIP heterodimer

.

• **Interaction with Plk1**: The Polo-like kinase (Plk1), a multifunctional cell cycle regulatory kinase, interacts with the MCM2-7 complex, including MCM7, in response to intra-S checkpoint activation, helping to **restore DNA replication**

.

As a core component of the MCM2-7 complex, MCM7 also implicitly contributes to its broader functions, which extend beyond DNA unwinding:

• **Origin Licensing and Activation**: The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin at replication origins during the G1 phase (origin licensing) and is activated in S phase by DDK and CDK kinases, forming the active CMG holo-helicase

.

• **"MCM Paradox"**: The presence of a superabundance of MCM2-7 complexes, known as the "MCM paradox," suggests that these complexes provide robustness to the system, allowing "dormant origins" to be activated under replication stress

.

• **Cohesin Regulation**: The MCM2-7 complex impacts chromosome dynamics, including cohesin loading and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion, through interactions with regulators like NIPBL/MAU2 and ESCO2

.

• **Transcription Coordination**: The complex helps mitigate transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and influences gene transcription, with its subunits being required for RNA Pol II-dependent transcription

. It can also resolve R-loops and interacts with the Integrator complex to promote RNA Pol II removal from paused promoters

.

• **Histone Inheritance and Epigenetic Memory**: The MCM2-7 complex plays a role in chromatin reassembly by coordinating histone deposition on newly replicated DNA, interacting with histone chaperones like AND-1 (Ctf4) and FACT to ensure the inheritance of histone marks and maintenance of cell identity
