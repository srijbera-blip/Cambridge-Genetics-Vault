The **Downstream Promoter Element (DPE)** is a significant component of eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) promoters

.

Here are the key details about DPEs:

• **Location**: The DPE is found **downstream of the transcription start site** (+1)

.

• **Prevalence**: It is a **common component of RNA Polymerase II promoters**, especially in those that **do not contain a TATA box**

.

• **Core Promoter Component**: A **core promoter** for RNA Polymerase II frequently includes an **Initiator (Inr)** in combination with either a TATA box or a DPE

.

• **Role in RNA Polymerase II Pausing**: The DPE is often associated with the **pause site** of RNA Polymerase II. In this "paused" state, RNA Pol II is already bound to the promoter, and its C-terminal domain (CTD) typically has Ser-5 phosphorylated. This pausing allows for rapid and synchronous transcriptional activation upon receiving further signals, as the polymerase is then released into elongation mode, which also involves Ser-2 CTD phosphorylation
