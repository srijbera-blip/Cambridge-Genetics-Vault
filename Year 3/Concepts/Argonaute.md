Argonaute proteins are a class of proteins that **bind to and mediate the functions of small non-coding RNA molecules**

. They are central to various gene silencing pathways.

Key aspects of Argonaute proteins include:

• **Association with Small RNAs**: Argonaute proteins bind to different types of small RNAs, including:

    ◦ **microRNAs (miRNAs)**: Single-stranded miRNAs associate with Argonaute (Ago) proteins, along with other proteins, to form an **RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)**

.

    ◦ **small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)**: siRNAs are also bound by Argonaute proteins

. An siRNA bound by an Argonaute protein is also referred to as the RISC complex

.

    ◦ **PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)**: piRNAs bind to specialized Argonaute proteins called **Piwi proteins**

.

• **Mechanisms of Action**:

    ◦ **mRNA Destabilization and Translational Inhibition**: When guided by sequence complementarity to target mRNAs, the RISC complex (containing Argonaute and miRNA or siRNA) **inhibits translation and destabilizes the target mRNAs**

. For miRNAs in animals, this base-pairing can allow for mismatches

.

    ◦ **"Slicing" Activity**: In the context of siRNAs, the Argonaute protein reveals a **"slicing" activity**, meaning it **cuts the target RNA at the siRNA binding site**, which leads to the subsequent degradation of the target RNA

. This is a core mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi)

.

    ◦ **Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS)**: While commonly known for post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGS) in the cytoplasm, siRNAs and piRNAs, bound to Argonaute proteins, can also **regulate transcription and heterochromatin formation in the nucleus**

. This nuclear RNAi-like pathway links small RNAs to chromatin modification and transcriptional repression

.

In summary, Argonaute proteins are essential effectors of small RNA-mediated gene regulation, leading to outcomes such as **target RNA degradation or translational inhibition**, and even transcriptional control
