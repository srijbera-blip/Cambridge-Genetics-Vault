TFIID (Transcription Factor II D) is a **multi-protein complex** and an **essential general (basal) transcription factor** required for eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to accurately initiate transcription at gene promoters. Its activity is crucial for regulating gene expression in eukaryotes

.

Here's a breakdown of TFIID's components and functions:

• **Components**

   TFIID is composed of the **[[TATA-binding protein]] (TBP) and a set of other proteins called [[TBP-associated factors]] (TAFs)

.

  **TBP** is a universal transcription factor, meaning it is required for transcription by Pol I, II, and III

. It binds to the **TATA box**, an A-T-rich octamer sequence commonly found in eukaryotic Pol II promoters, located approximately 25-30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. TBP binding to the TATA box causes a significant bend in the DNA, forming a "molecular saddle". Human TBP is approximately 38 kDa and its C-terminal repeat region is highly conserved, showing about 87% identity with _Drosophila_ TBP

.

    ◦ **TAFs** have diverse functions

:

        ▪ Some TAFs can **bind directly to promoter sequences**, particularly in Pol II promoters that lack TATA boxes, thereby aiding TFIID recruitment

.

        ▪ Some TAFs have **histone-like folds**

.

        ▪ They are **contacted by the activation domains of sequence-specific regulatory factors** (transcription factors), either directly or via co-activators

. This interaction allows for **synergy and combinatorial control** of gene expression, which is essential for the precise regulation observed in eukaryotic cells

.

        ▪ Specific TAF subunits, such as **TAF1 and TAF3**, contain **bromodomains** or **PHD fingers**, respectively, that can bind to **acetylated histones** (e.g., H3K9ac, H3K14ac) or **methylated histones** (e.g., H3K4me3)

. This binding increases TFIID's affinity for particular genes and contributes to transcription activation

.

        ▪ There is evidence of **"variant" TFIID complexes** with differing TAF content, which may have **tissue-specific characteristics** and contribute to specific gene expression programs

.

• **Function and Mechanism of Action**

    ◦ TFIID **nucleates the assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC)**, a multi-protein complex that includes RNA Polymerase II and other general transcription factors, necessary for transcription initiation

.

    ◦ It helps **determine the location of the transcription start site**

.

    ◦ TFIID **modulates transcription** and works **much better than TBP alone** in response to transcriptional activators, facilitating their influence on gene expression

.

    ◦ It plays a role in **recruiting RNA Polymerase II** to the promoter

.

    ◦ TFIID's function can **overlap with other co-activator complexes like Mediator**

.

    ◦ Its recruitment to promoters can be influenced by **histone and DNA modifications**

. For example, in the _IFN-β_ gene activation, TFIID is recruited through TBP binding to the TATA element and TAF1 bromodomains binding to H3K9ac and H3K14ac

.

• **Interaction with Other Factors**

    ◦ TFIID physically interacts with sequence-specific transcription factors and other co-activators, acting as a **physical bridge** to the basal transcription machinery

.

    ◦ For instance, activators can interact with TAFs, promoting synergistic control

.

    ◦ The Mediator complex, another large co-activator, also interacts with Pol II CTD and activators, and its functions can overlap with TFIID

.

In essence, TFIID serves as a central hub in eukaryotic transcription initiation, integrating signals from various regulatory factors and chromatin modifications to ensure precise and regulated gene expression.
