Position-effect variegation (PEV) is a genetic phenomenon where the expression of a gene is silenced when it is experimentally relocated to another region of a chromosome. It provides powerful evidence that [[chromatin structure]] can regulate gene expression, determining whether genes with identical DNA sequences will be active or silent

.

**Core Concept and Mechanism:**

• **Chromosomal Rearrangement**: PEV occurs when a gene, typically located in a transcriptionally active euchromatic region, is translocated or inverted to be near a region of constitutive heterochromatin, such as centromeres or telomeres

.

• **Heterochromatin Spreading**: The characteristic patchy phenotype arises because the tightly packed heterochromatin "spreads" into the relocated gene, silencing its transcription in some cells but not others

.

• **Limited Precision of Boundaries**: The boundaries between euchromatin and constitutive heterochromatin have limited precision, which can be observed in PEV

.

• **Random Initial Setting, Maintained Thereafter**: The initial setting of the chromatin boundary is random, but once established in a cell, that expression state (euchromatin/heterochromatin) is maintained in its daughter cells through mitosis

. This makes PEV a classic example of **epigenetic inheritance**

.

**Phenotypic Manifestation (Example in** **Drosophila****):**

• **The** **White** **Gene**: PEV was first described by Hermann Muller in _Drosophila_ using the _white_ gene, which is required for red eye pigment production

.

• **Mosaic Eyes**: Wild-type flies have uniform red eyes, while _white_ gene mutants have uniform white eyes

. When the _white_ gene is inverted to be near the heterochromatic centromere, flies develop eyes with **patches of red and white color**. White patches are derived from cells where _white_ gene transcription was silenced and remained silenced, while red patches come from cells where the gene remained active

.

**Experimental Exploitation and Key Proteins:**

• **Genetic Screens**: Geneticists have exploited PEV to identify proteins necessary for forming heterochromatin

.

    ◦ **Suppressors of Variegation (Su(var))**: Mutations in _Su(var)_ genes reduce the spread of heterochromatin, indicating that their wild-type products are required for heterochromatin spreading

.

    ◦ **Enhancers of Variegation (E(var))**: Mutations in _E(var)_ genes increase heterochromatin spreading, suggesting their normal function is to block spreading

.

• **Identified Proteins**: Over 300 _Su(var)_ mutants have been identified, including _Su(var)2-5_, which encodes **Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1)**, and _Su(var)3-9_, which encodes a **histone methyltransferase**

.

    ◦ **HP1**: Contains a chromodomain that binds **H3K9me3** and a chromoshadow domain involved in HP1 dimerization and recruitment of chromatin-modifying factors

.

    ◦ **Su(var)3-9**: Trimethylates H3K9

.

    ◦ **Feed-Forward Loop**: HP1 and Su(var)3-9 interact to create a feed-forward loop that spreads heterochromatin: HP1 binds H3K9me3, dimerizes, recruits Su(var)3-9 (which generates more H3K9me3), and this continues the process

. Proteins involved in heterochromatin spread include writers (HMTs), readers (HP1), and erasers of histone modifications

.

**Insulators (Boundary Elements):**

• In the absence of barriers, heterochromatin could spread into active gene regions, which would be disastrous for an organism

.

• **Boundary/Insulator elements** prevent the spreading of heterochromatin by creating a local environment unfavorable to heterochromatin formation

.

• **Insulator-binding proteins** may block spreading by recruiting activating enzymes (e.g., histone acetyltransferases, H3K4 methyltransferases, SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers) or by directly binding histones to block access

. In mammals, most known insulator sequences are bound by the **CTCF transcription factor**, which enforces DNA looping and can insulate genes from enhancers

.

**General Relevance:**

• Beyond centromeres and telomeres, the degree of chromatin compaction at transgene integration sites in mouse cells correlates with transcription levels, accounting for significant variation

.

• PEV highlights that differences in chromatin structure across chromosomes can be inherited and affect gene expression

.

• The study of PEV contributed significantly to understanding chromatin regulators

and the molecular mechanisms that alter chromatin structure to control gene expression in response to signals.
