The "writers" of the **histone code hypothesis** are **David Allis and Thomas Jenuwein**, who formally proposed this concept in **2000**

.

Their hypothesis posits that **multiple post-translational modifications** on histone tails, either sequentially or in combination, determine **unique transcriptional outcomes**

. These modifications comprise a form of **epigenetic information**, which is heritable information not encoded directly in the DNA sequence, and can dictate whether a specific genetic locus is active or inactive under particular cellular circumstances

.

Key aspects of the histone code hypothesis as described by Allis and Jenuwein include:

• **Histone Tails as Substrates**: The N and C terminal tails of histone proteins extend out from the nucleosome core, making them accessible to protein modifying enzymes

.

• **Types of Modifications**: Specific amino acids in these tails can be post-translationally modified by a wide array of chemical changes, such as **acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination**

.

• **Specific Outcomes**: Different combinations of these modifications are thought to convey distinct instructions to the transcription machinery

. For example, **trimethylation of lysine (K) 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3)** is commonly found at promoters of transcriptionally active genes, serving as a binding site for transcription coactivators like the PHD finger-containing TAF3 subunit of TFIID. In contrast, **trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3)** is associated with repressed genes and promotes heterochromatin formation by recruiting transcription corepressors such as the chromodomain-containing heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Other combinations, like phosphorylation of serine (S) 10 and acetylation of lysine 14 on histone H3 (H3S10P and H3K14ac), also signal transcription activation

.

• **Enormous Information Content**: The potential for information storage through these modifications is immense. For instance, the N-terminal tail of histone H3 alone can theoretically have over two million possible combinations of modifications

. These modifications create binding sites that can be "read" by various protein domains (e.g., bromodomains, chromodomains, PHD fingers) in transcription coregulators, thereby influencing gene expression

.

**Current Perspective**: While the histone code hypothesis was a significant development in understanding gene regulation, one source notes that this "notion is now outdated"

. Instead of viewing these modifications as a literal, deterministic code, the more contemporary understanding is that histone modifications **influence interactions among histones, and between histones and DNA**. They are also **recognized by chromatin-influencing proteins** which then mediate changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. This suggests a more dynamic and integrated role for histone modifications within the broader context of chromatin regulation.
