**MCM6** is one of the six ATPase subunits (MCM2-7) that form the **MCM2-7 complex**, which serves as the **replicative DNA helicase** in eukaryotic cells. This complex is responsible for unwinding the DNA double helix during DNA replication

.

Specific details about MCM6 from the sources include:

• **Helicase Activity**: MCM6, along with MCM4 and MCM7, constitutes a protein complex that has been shown to possess **DNA helicase activity**

. This highlights its direct involvement in the DNA unwinding function of the larger MCM2-7 complex

.

• **Interaction with Claspin**: The budding yeast ortholog of Claspin, called Mrc1, has been shown to **interact with the MCM6 subunit** of the helicase

. Mutations that disrupt this interaction lead to defects in the activation of the **replication checkpoint** in response to certain types of DNA damage

. This indicates MCM6's role in the DNA damage response and genome integrity pathways.

As part of the MCM2-7 complex, MCM6 is involved in broader cellular functions, as previously discussed:

• **DNA Replication Initiation and Activation**: The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin at replication origins during the G1 phase (origin licensing)

. It is then activated in S phase by kinases like CDK and DDK, and by associating with Cdc45 and the GINS complex to form the active **CMG holo-helicase**

.

• **Intra-S Phase Checkpoint**: The MCM2-7 complex is crucial for activating the intra-S phase checkpoint when replication forks stall

. MCM6's interaction with Claspin (Mrc1) directly supports its role in this checkpoint pathway

.

• **Histone Inheritance and Epigenetic Memory**: The MCM2-7 complex contributes to chromatin reassembly by coordinating histone deposition behind the replication fork, influencing epigenetic inheritance
