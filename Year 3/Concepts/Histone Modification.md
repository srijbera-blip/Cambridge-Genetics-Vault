- chemical alterations to the amino acids in histone proteins, primarily found int heir flexible tails but also in their histone-fold domains

### mechanism of action
- type of [[chromatin modification]]
- modifications can affect transcription by:
	- altering interactions between histones and DNA or between adjacent nucleosomes leading to more open or closed chromatin states
	- creates a bindings ite for reader proteins (Transcription coregulators) that interpret the modifications and recruit other complexes
	- influences the recruitment of transcription factors, coregulators, and general transcriptions to chromatin

### types of histone modifications
◦ **Acetylation**: Addition of an acetyl group to the amino group of lysine residues. This is a post-translational modification

.

        ▪ **Writers**: Histone acetyltransferases (HATs)

.

        ▪ **Erasers**: Histone deacetylases (HDACs)

.

        ▪ **Readers**: Bromodomains, found in some transcription regulatory factors like TAF1 subunit of TFIID

.

        ▪ **Effect**: Generally leads to more open chromatin and promotes transcription activation

.

    ◦ **Methylation**: Addition of methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues

.

        ▪ Lysine can be monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated

.

        ▪ Arginine can be monomethylated or dimethylated (symmetric or asymmetric)

.

        ▪ **Writers**: Histone methyltransferases (HMTs)

.

        ▪ **Erasers**: Histone demethylases (HDMs)

.

        ▪ **Readers**: Chromodomains or plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers

.

        ▪ **Effect**: Varies depending on the specific residue and degree of methylation. For example, H3K4me3 is associated with active promoters, while H3K9me3 is associated with repressed promoters and heterochromatin formation

.

    ◦ **Phosphorylation**: Addition of a phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues

.

        ▪ **Writers**: Kinases

.

        ▪ **Erasers**: Phosphatases

.

        ▪ **Readers**: 14-3-3 proteins

.

        ▪ **Effect**: Important regulatory mechanism, often involved in signaling cascades and can promote transcription activation, e.g., H3S10P

.

    ◦ **Ubiquitination**: Addition of the small polypeptide ubiquitin to lysine residues

.

        ▪ **Effect**: Can target proteins for degradation by the proteasome or regulate protein complex formation and localization

.

### [[histone code hypothesis]]

### role in gene regulation
- contribute to epigenetic inheritance
- Cellular memory: [[Polycomb group (PcG)]] and [[Trithorax group (TrxG)]] proteins maintain repressed and active transcriptional states, respectively by modifying histones (e.g. PcG trimethylates H3K27, TrxG acetylates H3K27)
- position effect variegation (PEV): occurs when genes are silenced by being relocated near heterochromatin. proteins involved in heterochromatin spreading include writers (HMTs like Su(var)3-9), readers (HP1 binding H3K9me3), and erasers of histone modifications
- X chromosome inactivation: silencing of one X Chromosome in females involves histone modifications like H3K9 methylation and histone deacetylation, leading to heterochromatin formation


### Connection to disease
◦ SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes are **frequently mutated in human cancers** (over 20%) and neurodevelopmental disorders

.

    ◦ These complexes often regulate histone modifications. For instance, SWI/SNF complexes interact with p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase to modulate H3K27 acetylation, which is crucial for enhancer activity and cell fate control

.

    ◦ Loss of SWI/SNF subunits can lead to **decreased global levels of H3K27ac**, particularly at enhancers, affecting the expression of genes linked to developmental processes

.

    ◦ Maintaining the correct stoichiometry of SWI/SNF subunits is important, as mutations altering subunit expression levels can lead to incorrect complex assemblies, impairing chromatin remodeling activity, which is relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers

.

    ◦ Disrupted histone methylation levels, for example, due to misregulation of m6A RNA methylation of chromatin regulator transcripts, can also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders
