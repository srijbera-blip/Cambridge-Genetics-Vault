Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a diverse group of RNA molecules that play crucial functional roles in cells ==without being translated into proteins==. While messenger RNAs (mRNAs) serve as intermediates in protein synthesis, ncRNAs are active as functional RNA molecules themselves. The understanding of RNA regulatory mechanisms has undergone a revolution, with several classes of regulatory RNAs identified

.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of ncRNAs:

**I. General Characteristics and Role in Gene Expression**

• **Definition:** ncRNAs are functional RNA molecules that are never translated into proteins

.

• **Abundance:** They make up the largest fraction of total cellular RNA. For example, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) account for nearly 95% of total RNA in a typical actively dividing eukaryotic cell, while mRNA accounts for only about 5%

.

• **Stability:** rRNAs and tRNAs are much more stable than mRNAs, remaining intact for longer periods

.

• **Central Dogma Exception:** The existence of solely protein-based or protein/RNA complexes represents a biological exception to the "central dogma of molecular biology" (DNA -> RNA -> Proteins)

.

• **Regulatory Functions:** ncRNAs are integral to gene expression control, acting at various stages, including transcription, post-transcription, and translation

. They provide an additional layer of specificity to gene expression control

.

• **Transcriptional Origins:** Many ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), are primarily transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)

, while others are transcribed by Pol I or Pol III

.

**II. Types of Non-Coding RNAs and Their Mechanisms**

1. **Transfer RNAs (tRNAs)**

    ◦ **Function:** tRNAs act as adaptors that decode mRNA nucleotide sequences into specific amino acids

. They carry out the decoding work of translation

.

    ◦ **Structure:**

        ▪ Single-stranded RNA molecules, approximately 75 nucleotides in length

.

        ▪ Fold into a characteristic cloverleaf shape, which further folds into an inverted L-shaped three-dimensional structure

.

        ▪ Contain an **anticodon loop** with a nucleotide triplet called an **anticodon**, which is complementary to the mRNA codon for the amino acid it carries

. Anticodons are oriented 3'-to-5' to base-pair with 5'-to-3' codons

.

        ▪ Have a conserved 5'-CCA-3' sequence at their 3' end, where the amino acid is attached

.

        ▪ Contain numerous **post-transcriptional modifications** (e.g., dihydrouridine, pseudouridine, inosine) that can affect base pairing (wobble) or tRNA recognition, folding, and stability

.

    ◦ **Charging:** Amino acids are attached to tRNAs by enzymes called **aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases** in an ATP-dependent two-step reaction

. A tRNA with an attached amino acid is called a **charged tRNA**. This correct charging is a critical step in ensuring accurate translation

.

    ◦ **Wobble Base Pairing:** Some tRNAs can recognize more than one codon due to "wobble" base pairing at the third position of a codon, allowing for fewer than 61 tRNAs to read all 61 amino-acid-specifying codons

.

    ◦ **Export:** tRNAs interact with exportin-t for their export from the nucleus

.

    ◦ **Transcription:** Synthesized by RNA Polymerase III

.

2. **Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)**

    ◦ **Function:** rRNAs are structural and functional components of **ribosomes**, the molecular machines that catalyze protein synthesis

. They bring together charged tRNAs and mRNAs to translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein

.

    ◦ **Composition:** Ribosomes are approximately two-thirds RNA by mass and one-third protein

.

    ◦ **Catalytic Activity (Ribozyme):** rRNAs are now understood to be catalytic RNAs (ribozymes), with the peptidyltransferase center and decoding center within the ribosome being built entirely of rRNA

. The large ribosomal subunit functions as a ribozyme to catalyze peptide bond formation

.

    ◦ **Structure:** rRNAs fold into stable secondary structures through intramolecular base pairing

.

    ◦ **Role in Initiation:** In bacteria, the **Shine-Dalgarno sequence** in mRNA base-pairs with the 3' end of the 16S rRNA in the small ribosomal subunit, correctly positioning the AUG initiation codon in the P site

. This highlights rRNA's key role in ribosome positioning for translation

.

    ◦ **Transcription:** rRNA precursors are produced by RNA Polymerase I in the nucleolus, a large subnuclear compartment

. They constitute about 50% of cellular RNA. The genes are generally found in tandem arrays

.

3. **MicroRNAs (miRNAs)**

    ◦ **Nature:** Small (~22 nucleotides) single-stranded RNAs

.

    ◦ **Abundance and Scope:** Hundreds are found in mammals (e.g., ~675 human ones, potentially up to 1000), regulating the expression of up to 30% of human genes

. Each miRNA can potentially target several hundred transcripts, and many transcripts can contain sites for multiple miRNAs

.

    ◦ **Transcription:** Mostly transcribed by RNA Polymerase II

, often in a tissue-specific manner. The primary transcripts are called **pri-miRNAs**

.

Processing:** Pri-miRNAs are processed by the RNase III enzymes **Drosha** and **Dicer** into mature miRNAs
	pri-mrnas are primary transcripts that serve as precursors to miRNAs

.

    ◦ **Mechanism of Action:**

   Mature miRNAs are bound by **[[Argonaute]] (Ago) proteins** to form an **[[RNA-induced silencing complex]] (RISC)**

.

        ▪ RISC is guided to target mRNAs through imperfect base-pairing (mismatches are allowed in animals)

.

        ▪ This binding inhibits translation and destabilizes the target mRNAs

.

        ▪ Examples like the _let-7_ gene in _C. elegans_, which does not encode a protein but produces a mature 22-nucleotide RNA that hinders translation of target genes, illustrate their role in developmental timing

. The _let-7_ miRNA is widely conserved across species

.

    ◦ **Biological Importance:** Essential for animal and plant development

. Involved in processes like cell differentiation, growth, and proliferation

.

    ◦ **Export:** MicroRNA precursors interact with exportin 5 for transport out of the nucleus

.

    ◦ **Polycistronic Nature:** miRNAs can be polycistronic, meaning one primary transcript can encode multiple mature miRNAs

.

4. **Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)**

    ◦ **Nature:** Short (~23 nucleotides) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules

.

    ◦ **Relationship to miRNAs:** siRNAs are part of a related pathway to miRNAs

.

    ◦ **Processing:** Long dsRNA molecules are processed by the RNase **Dicer** into siRNAs

.

    ◦ **Mechanism of Action:**

        ▪ SiRNAs are bound by **Argonaute proteins** to form the **RISC complex**

.

        ▪ The Argonaute protein in RISC has "slicing" activity, cutting the target RNA at the binding site, leading to its degradation

. This mechanism requires perfect complementarity between the siRNA and the target mRNA

.

    ◦ **Applications:** RNA interference (RNAi), the biological process mediated by siRNAs, is a great experimental tool for inactivating specific genes and has potential therapeutic applications

.

    ◦ **Antiviral Immunity:** Important in antiviral immunity, where they destroy the genomes of RNA viruses during replication

.

    ◦ **Nuclear Regulation:** Beyond their cytoplasmic role (post-transcriptional gene regulation, PTGS), siRNAs can also regulate transcription and heterochromatin formation in the nucleus, a process known as **transcriptional gene silencing (TGS)** or co-transcriptional gene silencing (coTGS)

. Nuclear RNAi-like phenomena linked to chromatin modification have been well-defined in organisms like _S. pombe_, plants, and nematodes

.

5. **PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)**

    ◦ **Nature:** Small non-coding RNAs, distinct from miRNAs and siRNAs

.

    ◦ **Expression:** Primarily expressed in the germline

.

    ◦ **Mechanism:**

        ▪ They target RNA produced by **transposable elements**

.

        ▪ Bind to specialized **Argonaute proteins called Piwi proteins**

.

        ▪ Act in both the cytoplasm (PTGS) and the nucleus (TGS)

.

    ◦ **Biological Importance:** Often referred to as "guardians of the genome" because their pathway is essential for keeping the genome of germ cells safe; a lack of the piRNA pathway leads to infertility

. They provide a "memory" of transposable elements within a genome

.

    ◦ **Nuclear Regulation:** Like siRNAs, the piRNA pathway can also regulate transcription and heterochromatin formation, acting via the nuclear RNAi pathway (e.g., in flies, nematodes, and likely mammals)

.

6. **Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs)**

    ◦ **Nature:** RNA molecules greater than 200 nucleotides in length that do not encode proteins

.

    ◦ **Discovery History:** Though considered "newest kids on the block," some, like **Xist** (X-inactive specific transcript), have been known since the 1990s

.

    ◦ **Diversity of Roles/Mechanisms:**

        ▪ **Structural RNAs:** Can play structural roles in transcription and chromatin regulation

.

        ▪ **Chromatin Modulation:** The process of transcription of lncRNAs itself can affect local chromatin structure

.

        ▪ **Antisense Transcription:** Some are transcribed in an antisense direction relative to protein-coding genes

.

        ▪ **Enhancer Transcription:** Can be transcribed from enhancer regions

.

        ▪ **Transcriptional Noise:** While contributing to the fact that over 80% of the human genome is transcribed (compared to ~2% coding), some lncRNAs may represent "transcriptional noise" without clear biological function

.

    ◦ **Models of Action**

**:**

        ▪ **Decoys:** They can titrate away DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors, preventing them from binding to their target DNA

.

        ▪ **Scaffolds:** They can bring two or more proteins together into a complex or spatial proximity

.

        ▪ **Guides:** They can recruit proteins, like chromatin modification enzymes, to specific DNA locations through RNA-DNA or RNA-protein interactions

.

        ▪ **Chromosome Looping:** They can facilitate chromosome looping in an enhancer-like model, defining the _cis_ nature and spread of their effects

.

    ◦ **Epigenetic Inheritance:** lncRNAs, such as Xist, are considered elements of epigenetic inheritance, playing a central role in initiating the silencing of one X chromosome in mammals

.

7. **Small Nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)**

    ◦ **Function:** Involved in RNA splicing

. For example, U2 snRNA is used in RNA splicing

.

    ◦ **Transcription:** Synthesized by RNA Polymerase II (e.g., U2 snRNA) and RNA Polymerase III

. Their genes are scattered throughout the genome

.

**III. Shared Concepts and Importance**

• **Accessory Factors:** All RNA polymerases (Pol I, II, and III) require accessory factors to accurately recognize promoter DNA, act in regulated ways, elongate processively, and generate correctly processed transcripts

.

• **Transcript Modifications:** Capping, splicing, and poly-adenylation are common modifications for eukaryotic RNA transcripts

. While primarily associated with Pol II transcripts, capping and splicing can also occur for Pol I and Pol III transcripts

.

• **Epigenetic Regulation:** NcRNAs are increasingly recognized as key players in epigenetic regulation, contributing to heritable information beyond the primary DNA sequence

. This includes phenomena like Position-Effect Variegation (PEV), where chromatin states are inherited through mitosis

.

• **Genome Annotation:** Identification and annotation of various ncRNA transcripts are crucial for understanding the functional elements of a genome, alongside protein-coding regions

. Techniques like RNA-seq are used for genome-wide analysis of RNA transcripts.
