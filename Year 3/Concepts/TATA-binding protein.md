TBP (TATA-binding protein) is a **fundamental component** of the eukaryotic transcription machinery, playing a central role in the **initiation of gene expression** by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and other RNA polymerases

.

Here is a comprehensive description of TBP:

• **Core Identity and Role:**

    ◦ TBP is a **key subunit** of the **TFIID (Transcription Factor II D) multi-protein complex**

.

    ◦ It is an **essential general (basal) transcription factor** required for RNA Polymerase II to accurately initiate transcription at gene promoters

.

    ◦ TBP's primary function is to **nucleate the assembly of other general transcription factors (GTFs)**, thereby initiating the formation of the **pre-initiation complex (PIC)** at core promoters

.

    ◦ It also plays a crucial role in **determining the precise location of the transcription start site**

.

• **Structure and DNA Binding:**

   TBP **binds specifically to the [[TATA box]]**, an A-T-rich octamer sequence frequently found in eukaryotic Pol II promoters, located approximately 25-30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (+1)

.

    ◦ Unlike many DNA-binding proteins, TBP binds the TATA box in the **minor groove** of the DNA

.

    ◦ This binding induces a **significant bend in the DNA**, forming a distinct "molecular saddle" structure

.

    ◦ Human TBP is approximately **38 kDa**

.

    ◦ It contains **two direct repeats**, suggesting an evolutionary origin from a duplicated and fused gene that once functioned as a homodimer

.

• **Universality and Conservation:**

    ◦ TBP is considered a **"universal" transcription factor** because it is not limited to Pol II; it is **also required for transcription by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) and RNA Polymerase III (Pol III)**

.

    ◦ TBP is **highly conserved across evolution**. For instance, the C-terminal repeat region of human TBP shares about **87% sequence identity with** **Drosophila** **TBP**

. This high conservation underscores its fundamental importance in eukaryotic gene expression

.

• **Interaction within TFIID and with Activators:**

    ◦ TFIID is composed of TBP and a set of **TBP-associated factors (TAFs)**

.

    ◦ While TBP alone can bind the TATA box, the **full TFIID complex (TBP + TAFs) works much more effectively than TBP alone** in response to signals from transcriptional activators

.

    ◦ TAFs within TFIID can be directly contacted by the activation domains of sequence-specific regulatory factors (transcription factors), facilitating synergy and combinatorial control of gene expression

.

    ◦ In the context of activating specific genes, such as the _IFN-β_ gene, TFIID recruitment is enhanced by **TBP's direct binding to the TATA element and by the binding of TAF1 bromodomains to acetylated histones** (H3K9ac and H3K14ac)

.

• **Influence of Chromatin Structure:**

    ◦ The packaging of DNA into chromatin can **repress transcription** by making DNA inaccessible. Specifically, **nucleosomes may inhibit the binding of TBP (and TFIID)** to TATA boxes

. This highlights that TBP's ability to bind DNA is regulated by the chromatin state.

• **Methods of Study:**

    ◦ The binding of TBP to DNA can be studied using **DNA footprinting**, which identifies specific DNA sequences protected by protein binding from nuclease digestion

.

    ◦ **Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)**, particularly in its sequencing-based form (ChIP-seq), provides **direct evidence for the binding sites of TBP** and other transcription factors in living cells or tissues
