The **Pre-initiation Complex (PIC)** is a **multi-protein complex** that assembles at the core promoter of eukaryotic genes and is **necessary for transcription initiation** by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). RNA Polymerase II, along with RNA Polymerase I and III, cannot effectively initiate transcription alone and requires these additional accessory factors

.

Here is a comprehensive description of the PIC:

• **Definition and Core Function:**

    ◦ The PIC is the **assembled complex of RNA Polymerase II and various General Transcription Factors (GTFs)** at a eukaryotic gene's core promoter

.

    ◦ Its fundamental role is to **accurately recognize promoter DNA** and establish the machinery for transcription

.

    ◦ It also plays a crucial role in **determining the precise location of the transcription start site (+1)**

.

• **Key Components (General Transcription Factors - GTFs):** The PIC assembly involves a sequential recruitment of several GTFs, primarily named TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, along with RNA Polymerase II itself

. These factors are generally specific for one RNA polymerase (Pol I, II, or III)

.

• **Step-by-Step Assembly Process:** The formation of the PIC is a highly ordered process that ensures accurate and regulated transcription initiation:

    1. **TFIID Binding:** The process typically begins with **TFIID (Transcription Factor II D)** binding to the core promoter

.

        ▪ TFIID is a **multi-protein complex** consisting of the **TATA-binding protein (TBP)** and a set of **TBP-associated factors (TAFs)**

.

        ▪ **TBP** is a universal transcription factor (also required for Pol I and Pol III transcription)

. It binds specifically to the **TATA box**, an A-T-rich octamer sequence located approximately 25-30 base pairs upstream of the start site, inserting into the minor groove and inducing a significant **bend in the DNA**, forming a "molecular saddle"

.

        ▪ **TAFs** have multiple functions: some **bind directly to promoter sequences** (particularly important for Pol II promoters that lack a TATA box), and some are **contacted by activation domains of upstream sequence-specific activators**

. TFIID is more effective than TBP alone in responding to activators

.

        ▪ TFIID serves to **nucleate the assembly of other GTFs**

.

    2. **TFIIA Stabilization:** **TFIIA** binds to and **stabilizes the interaction of TFIID with DNA**. In humans, TFIIA has three subunits

.

    3. **TFIIB Bridging:** **TFIIB** bridges the interaction between TFIID and Pol II

. It has some sequence preference for DNA binding, recognizing the weakly-conserved BRE element just upstream of the TATA box, and helps to define the transcription start site

.

    4. **Pol II and TFIIF Recruitment:** **RNA Polymerase II** enters the complex along with **TFIIF**

. TFIIF is comprised of two proteins (RAP 30 and RAP 74) that bind to Pol II and show weak similarities to bacterial sigma factors

.

    5. **TFIIE and TFIIH Entry:** Subsequently, **TFIIE** (two polypeptides in humans) and **TFIIH** enter the complex

.

    6. **TFIIH Functions (Melting and Phosphorylation):** **TFIIH** is critical for promoter opening and Pol II activation:

        ▪ It contains **helicase activities** that use ATP hydrolysis to unwind and melt the promoter DNA, making the template strand accessible

.

        ▪ It also possesses a **kinase activity** that **phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD)** of the largest Pol II subunit

. This phosphorylation is linked to Pol II processivity and coupling transcription to RNA processing events like splicing and poly-adenylation

.

• **Regulation and Chromatin Context:**

    ◦ The assembly and activity of the PIC are highly influenced by the **chromatin structure**. Nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin states generally repress transcription by inhibiting the binding of TBP (TFIID) and other factors to their cognate DNA sites

. Chromatin "dampens down" transcription, and activators function by relieving this repression

.

    ◦ **Histone modifications** play a direct role in PIC assembly. For example, during the activation of the _IFN-β_ gene, TFIID recruitment is aided by TAF1 bromodomains binding to acetylated histones (H3K9ac and H3K14ac). The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which alters nucleosome positioning, is also recruited to the promoter during PIC assembly

.

    ◦ **Transcriptional activators** can directly or indirectly recruit basal transcription factors, including those in the PIC, and can influence their activity and conformation

. The Mediator complex, a co-activator, also plays a role in bringing together GTFs, RNAPII, and transcription factors.
