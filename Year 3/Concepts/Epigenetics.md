Epigenetics refers to a form of inheritance where information stored in the structure of chromatin is passed down through cell divisions, affecting the traits of daughter cells without altering the underlying DNA sequence. This means that the collection of genes transcribed in a parent cell can be reproduced in daughter cells through the maintenance of chromatin structure by histone and DNA modifying and chromatin remodeling mechanisms

.

Here's a detailed look into the concept of epigenetics, drawing from the sources:

• **Chromatin as the Substrate for Regulation**

    ◦ In eukaryotic cells, **DNA is packaged with proteins to create chromatin**

. This packaging compresses DNA significantly, over 10,000-fold compared to its linear form, to fit into the nucleus

.

    ◦ The structure of chromatin not only facilitates DNA compaction but also serves as a substrate for **reversible changes in protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that regulate transcription**

.

    ◦ Generally, eukaryotic genes are inaccessible and transcriptionally silent unless activated due to DNA being packaged into chromatin

.

• **Mechanisms of Epigenetic Regulation** Eukaryotic cells employ two primary mechanisms to dynamically regulate gene transcription by altering chromatin structure: chromatin modification and chromatin remodeling

.

    1. **Chromatin Modification**

        ▪ **Histone Modifications**: Enzymes can alter the chemical structure of amino acids in histones

.

            • **Acetylation**: The addition of an acetyl group to lysine residues in histones by **histone acetyltransferases (HATs)**

. This neutralizes the positive charge of lysine, which can **reduce chromatin compaction**, increase DNA accessibility for transcription machinery, and **promote transcription activation**. **Histone deacetylases (HDACs)** remove these acetyl groups, increasing compaction and promoting repression. Acetylation also creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing proteins, like TAF1, which further activate transcription. HATs are considered "writers," HDACs "erasers," and bromodomains "readers" of histone acetylation

.

            • **Other Modifications**: Histones can also be methylated (lysine and arginine), phosphorylated (serine, threonine, tyrosine), and ubiquitinated (lysine)

. These modifications are added by "writer" enzymes (e.g., histone methyltransferases, HMTs), removed by "eraser" enzymes (e.g., histone demethylases, HDMs), and bound by "reader" proteins (e.g., chromodomains, PHD fingers)

.

            • **Histone Code Hypothesis**: This proposes that **multiple histone modifications, acting sequentially or in combination on one or several histone tails, specify unique transcription outcomes**

. For example, H3K4me3 is common at active gene promoters, activating transcription, while H3K9me3 is associated with repressed genes, serving as a binding site for [[corepressors]] like HP1 that promote heterochromatin formation

.

        ▪ **DNA Modifications**: In vertebrates, the predominant DNA modification is **5-methylcytosine (5mC)**, where methylation occurs at the fifth carbon in the cytosine ring of the dinucleotide CpG

.

            • **DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)** are "writers" that add methyl groups, while TET enzymes are "erasers" that reverse this methylation

.

            • **Unmethylated CpG islands at promoters are generally correlated with open chromatin and active transcription**, while methylated islands are associated with closed chromatin and repressed transcription

. Methylation can interfere with transcription factor binding and recruit methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins, which in turn recruit transcription repressors like HDACs or HMTs (e.g., those producing H3K9me3)

.

    2. **Chromatin Remodeling**

        ▪ Chromatin remodeling complexes use **energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt non-covalent histone-DNA interactions**

. This can involve sliding, ejecting, or replacing histone octamers on DNA, or exchanging canonical histones with variant histones

.

        ▪ These actions make DNA either more or less accessible to transcription regulators

. For example, the **[[SWI-SNF|SWI/SNF]] complex** remodels nucleosomes by removing H2A/H2B dimers and then the rest of the histone octamer, influencing transcription. The **SWR1 complex** assembles the variant histone H2A-Z into chromatin by exchanging H2A-Z/H2B dimers for H2A/H2B dimers, making nucleosomes more prone to disassembly and increasing DNA access for transcription regulators

.

• **Examples of Epigenetic Phenomena** Epigenetic control of transcription can be observed at various levels, from specific genes to entire chromosomes, and is maintained through cell divisions

.

    1. **Cellular Memory**: This is the process by which changes in cell fate, initiated by short-lived signals, persist through successive cell divisions even after the initial signal is gone

. **Polycomb group proteins** maintain genes in a transcriptionally repressed state, while **Trithorax group proteins** maintain genes in an active state. These proteins are components of multiprotein complexes that modify histones and remodel chromatin, often acting in opposition

.

    2. **Position-Effect Variegation (PEV)**: In _Drosophila_, the expression of genes can be silenced when they are relocated near heterochromatic regions of a chromosome

. For instance, the _white_ gene, normally responsible for red eye pigment, can be silenced when moved near the heterochromatic centromere, leading to patches of white and red in the eye. This demonstrates that chromatin structure can regulate gene expression without changes in DNA sequence and is inherited across cell generations. Proteins like **heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)** and **Su(var)3-9** (a histone methyltransferase) are crucial for the spread of heterochromatin

.

    3. **Genomic Imprinting**: In mammals, certain autosomal genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, meaning only the allele inherited from one parent (maternal or paternal) is expressed, while the other is silenced

. This is controlled by DNA regulatory elements called **imprinting control regions (ICRs)**, which have parent-specific chromatin modifications like DNA methylation. For example, in the _Igf2_ and _H19_ gene cluster in mice, the ICR is methylated in male germ cells and unmethylated in female germ cells. This difference, and the ability of the CTCF protein to bind only to the unmethylated ICR, determines which gene is activated or silenced from each parent

.

    4. **X-Chromosome Inactivation**: In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced to balance gene dosage with males

. The inactivated X chromosome forms a **Barr body**, a highly condensed heterochromatic structure. This process involves a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) called **Xist**, which spreads along the future inactive X chromosome and recruits factors like **PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)** that catalyze heterochromatin-associated modifications such as H3K27me3, leading to silencing

.

In essence, while the DNA sequence provides the genetic blueprint, epigenetic mechanisms layer additional information through chromatin structure and modifications, dictating which genes are expressed and when, and ensuring that these expression patterns are faithfully transmitted during cell division without altering the underlying genetic code
