- primary form of methylation in vertebrates --> 5-methylcytosine
	- involves addition of methyl group to 5th carbon in the cytosine ring within a CpG dinucleotide
	- catalysed by DNMT
		- uses s-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor

### location and context
- genomic distribution: around 85% of CpGs are methylated across genome
	- remaining often cluster in 200-4000 base pairs known as [[CpG islands]]
	- half of these islands are found in gene promoters - other half in intragenic and intergenic regions
	- majority of promoters associated with a CpG island
- species variation: DNA methylation patterns vary among organisms. 
	- in plants, 5mC can occur in CpG dinucleotides and other nucleotide contexts. in contrast, little to no DNA methylation detected in Drosophila, C. elegans and S. cerevisiae

### role in [[gene regulation]] and [[Chromatin Structure]]
- transcriptional repression - methylation of CpG islands at gene promoters generally correlated with closed chromatin and repressed transcription
- represses transcription by two main mechanisms:
	- interfering with transcription factor binding
	- recruiting repressors - methylated CpGs act as binding sites for methyl binding domain proteins (MBD) --> these act as readers of DNA modification, recruit transcription [[corepressors]] like HDAC or HMT --> these produce the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 (trimethylation of lysine on histone H3) 
	illustrates cross stalk between DNA methylation and histone modifications


### writers, erasers and readers
writers: DNMT
Erasers: TET
Readers: variety of proteins acts as readers by binding to either unmethylated or methylated CpGs
	e.g. Cfp1 binds unmethylated CpGs and recruits an HMT that produces the activating histone modification H3K4me3 (transcription activating)



### reversal of methylation
- CpG is a reversible process
- TET enzymes catalyse the reversal in three steps, with 2nd and 3rd intermediates being rapidly excised
- first intermediate more stable and is particularly abundant in [[embryonic stem cells]]


### Laboratory Detection:

• DNA methylation is detected in the laboratory using the **sodium bisulfite reaction**

. In this method, DNA isolated from cells is treated with sodium bisulfite, which converts cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA but inefficiently converts 5mC to thymine. After the reaction, the DNA is sequenced, and cytosines that were converted to uracil are read as thymine (T), while 5mC that remained unchanged are read as cytosine (C)

.

### Epigenetic Significance:

• DNA methylation is a key component of **epigenetic inheritance**, where information stored in chromatin structure is inherited through cell divisions without altering the DNA sequence

. This epigenetic information, along with histone modifications, is faithfully copied from parent to daughter cells during DNA replication. Genomic imprinting, where certain autosomal genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, is a classic example of epigenetic regulation involving specific patterns of DNA methylation and histone modification
