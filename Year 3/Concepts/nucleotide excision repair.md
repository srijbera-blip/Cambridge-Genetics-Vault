**NER** stands for **Nucleotide Excision Repair**

.

Here's what the sources tell us about NER:

• **Definition**: It is a **DNA repair pathway** that removes damaged bases

.

• **Function**: NER specifically **removes damaged bases** from DNA

.

• **Connection to TFIIH**: Components of **[[TFIIH]] (Transcription Factor II H)** are involved in this repair pathway

. TFIIH is a general transcription factor with helicase and kinase activities, playing a role in promoter opening during transcription initiation

.

• **Targeting Preference**: NER is **preferentially targeted to transcribed regions of the genome**

. More specifically, it is selectively targeted to the **transcribed (template) strand**. This preferential targeting is noted as making sense in the context of gene expression.
