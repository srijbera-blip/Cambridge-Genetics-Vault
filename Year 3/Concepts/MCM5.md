**MCM5** is one of the six ATPase subunits (MCM2-7) that compose the **MCM2-7 complex**, which serves as the **replicative DNA helicase** in eukaryotic cells. This complex is fundamental for unwinding the DNA double helix during DNA replication, providing the necessary single-stranded DNA template for DNA polymerases

.

While MCM5 is an integral part of the MCM2-7 helicase, the sources highlight a specific non-canonical role for MCM5 in **transcription regulation**:

• **Interaction with Stat1**: MCM subunits, including MCM5, **interact directly with the Stat1 transcriptional activator**

. Stat1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) is a protein activated by phosphorylation by JAK tyrosine kinase, which then leads to the transcription of downstream cytokine genes

.

• **Essential for Transcriptional Activity**: The **phosphorylation-dependent interaction of MCM5 with Stat1 is essential for Stat1's transcriptional activity** in cytokine gene activation

. This suggests that the MCM2-7 complex, through MCM5, can function as a chromatin-bound scaffold to enhance specific transcriptional pathways

.

Beyond this specific function of MCM5, the MCM2-7 complex as a whole performs a variety of crucial roles in maintaining genome integrity by integrating DNA replication with other nuclear activities:

• **DNA Replication**: The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin at replication origins during the G1 phase (origin licensing) in an ATP-dependent manner

. It is activated in S phase by CDK and DDK kinases and by associating with Cdc45 and GINS, forming the active CMG holo-helicase. This complex then unwinds DNA and translocates along the DNA with the replication forks

.

• **Prevention of Re-initiation**: After replication, the MCM2-7 complex is unloaded from DNA to prevent re-initiation in the same cell cycle, a process involving polyubiquitination of MCM7 and removal by proteins like p97/VCP/Cdc48

.

• **"MCM Paradox"**: More MCM2-7 complexes are loaded than strictly needed, providing robustness to the system by allowing "dormant origins" to activate under replication stress

.

• **Non-Canonical Roles**: The MCM2-7 complex acts as a central hub for various nuclear processes

:

    ◦ **Cohesin Regulation**: It impacts chromosome dynamics, promoting cohesin loading and contributing to sister chromatid cohesion, in part through direct interaction with ESCO2 cohesin acetyltransferase and potentially MCM3

.

    ◦ **Transcription Coordination**: It is involved in mitigating transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) by potentially displacing RNA Pol II and unwinding R-loops

. It also interacts with the Integrator complex to promote RNA Pol II removal from paused promoters

.

    ◦ **Intra-S Phase Checkpoint**: The complex is critical for activating the intra-S phase checkpoint when replication forks stall and is a direct target of ATM and ATR kinases

. MCM2 is phosphorylated by ATR, and MCM3 by ATM

.

    ◦ **Histone Inheritance and Epigenetic Memory**: It contributes to chromatin reassembly after replication, notably through the interaction of MCM2 with AND-1 (Ctf4 in yeast) and FACT histone chaperones, which helps recycle parental histones and maintain epigenetic marks
