The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are a crucial class of proteins involved in maintaining cellular memory and regulating gene expression, primarily by keeping genes in a **transcriptionally repressed state** through successive cell divisions. This chromatin-based mechanism is essential for maintaining cellular identity throughout development

.

Here's a detailed look at the Polycomb group:

• **Role in Cellular Memory and Development**

   PcG proteins, along with [[Trithorax group (TrxG)]] proteins, provide a **memory or maintenance of gene expression** through many rounds of cell division

. They ensure that the transcription state of genes established in a parent cell is reproduced in daughter cells

.

   PcG proteins often function in **opposition** to TrxG proteins; while PcG maintains genes in a repressed state, TrxG maintains them in an active state

. This antagonism helps regulate gene expression coupled to cellular memory

.

    ◦ In _Drosophila_, PcG pathways maintain the spatially-restricted expression of homeotic genes, which define the body plan

. These homeotic genes, such as _Ubx_, _abd-A_, and _Abd-B_ in the Bithorax complex (BX-C), are regulated by PcG through **Polycomb Response Elements (PREs)**

.

• **Polycomb Response Elements (PREs)**

   PREs are DNA sequences that provide a **memory function**, maintaining gene expression patterns through cell divisions even in the absence of the transcription factors that initially set the pattern

.

   Unlike [[enhancers]], which provide initial spatial information and function early in development, PREs serve purely a **maintenance role**, not containing positional information themselves

. Experiments have shown that the maintained pattern is determined by the enhancer, not the PRE's usual location

.

• **Molecular Mechanisms of Silencing**

    ◦ PcG proteins are components of multi-protein complexes that **post-translationally modify histones and remodel chromatin**

.

    ◦ **Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)**: This complex **trimethylates histone H3 at Lysine 27 (H3K27me3)** via the SET domain of its subunit Enhancer of zeste (EZH2, also called E(z))

. PRC2 binding to H3K27me3 stimulates its own activity, creating a **self-reinforcing loop** that spreads this repressive mark

.

    ◦ **Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1)**: PRC1 binds to **H3K27me3** histone tails through the chromodomain of its subunit Polycomb (Pc, also called CBX)

. PRC1 also catalyzes the **monoubiquitylation of histone H2A at Lysine 118 (H2AK118; K119 in vertebrates)** through its RING subunit (e.g., RING1A and RING1B)

.

    ◦ In addition to histone modification, PRC1 **compacts chromatin**, independent of its ubiquitylation activity

. H2A ubiquitylation correlates with **poised RNA Polymerase II**, indicating a state where Pol II is bound but not actively elongating transcription. This mechanism may inhibit elongation

.

    ◦ The trimethylation by PcG complexes blocks the activating acetylation by TrxG complexes on H3K27, as these modifications are mutually exclusive

. Acetylation also counteracts chromatin compaction

.

• **Recruitment and Regulation**

    ◦ PcG and TrxG proteins are recruited to PREs through a platform of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins

.

    ◦ Targeting of PcG complexes to chromatin is also influenced by transcription factors, other histone modifications, DNA methylation, and **long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)**

. A notable example is the lncRNA **Xist**, which recruits PRC2 (leading to H3K27me3) to initiate transcriptional silencing during X-chromosome inactivation in mammals

.

In summary, PcG proteins are central to epigenetic memory, ensuring that gene expression states are stably inherited through cell divisions by orchestrating specific histone modifications and chromatin compaction, thereby contributing significantly to the faithful development and maintenance of cellular identity
