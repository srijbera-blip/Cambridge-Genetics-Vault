Topoisomerases are **enzymes that play a crucial role in managing the topological state of DNA**. They are essential for various cellular processes by **altering the number of times DNA strands wind around each other**

.

Here's a full account of topoisomerases:

• **Function and the Problem of Supercoiling**:

    ◦ In eukaryotic cells, a significant amount of DNA (approximately two meters in a human cell) is compacted into a sphere about 10µm in diameter

. This compaction is achieved by the association of genomic DNA with structural components of chromatin, such as histone proteins, forming ordered nucleosomes

.

    ◦ This tight packaging, along with processes like DNA replication and transcription that involve unwinding the DNA helix, creates **topological problems**, specifically the generation of supercoils

. Supercoiling can either be relaxed or highly compact, as seen in circular eukaryotic DNA viruses. These turns in the DNA must be resolved to allow further biological processes

.

    ◦ DNA topoisomerases resolve these issues by **transiently breaking and resealing the DNA backbone**, thereby relaxing supercoiled DNA

.

• **Types and Mechanisms**:

    ◦ **DNA Topoisomerase I**:

        ▪ This enzyme acts by **nicking a single strand of a DNA duplex**

.

        ▪ It then **covalently attaches a DNA phosphate group to a tyrosine residue in its active center**, forming a new ester bond

.

        ▪ This allows the **free end of the cut strand to rotate around the uncut single strand**

.

        ▪ Finally, it **seals the nick by breaking the ester bond with the tyrosine and re-ligating the DNA**, all **without requiring ATP**

.

        ▪ This process efficiently **removes strain caused by local helix unwinding** that occurs in front of active DNA or RNA polymerases

.

    ◦ **DNA Topoisomerase II**:

        ▪ Unlike Topoisomerase I, this enzyme **cuts both strands of the DNA**

.

        ▪ It then **bridges the gap, allowing other regions of the DNA duplex to pass through** before resealing

.

        ▪ This action effectively **removes supercoils from the DNA**

.

        ▪ Beyond supercoil removal, Topoisomerase II is also capable of **separating interlocked DNA rings**, known as concatenates or catenanes. This function is **essential during the final stages of DNA replication and mitosis**

.

• **Roles in Cellular Processes**:

    ◦ **DNA Replication**: They are crucial for releasing superhelical stress that builds up ahead of moving replication forks

. Specifically, Topoisomerase II is vital for separating interlocked DNA rings at the end of replication

.

    ◦ **Transcription**: Topoisomerase I removes strain caused by local helix unwinding in front of active RNA polymerases during transcription

.

    ◦ **Chromatin Organization**: DNA topoisomerase II is suggested to be involved in **controlling the coiling of topologically closed DNA loops on the nuclear matrix or scaffold**

. MARs (matrix- or scaffold-associated regions) in chromatin contain weak consensus sites for this enzyme, hinting at its role in higher-order chromatin structure

.

    ◦ **Mitosis**: Topoisomerase II is essential for separating interlocked DNA rings, which occurs during the final stages of mitosis to ensure proper chromosome segregation

.

In summary, topoisomerases are indispensable enzymes that maintain the structural integrity and accessibility of DNA throughout the cell cycle, enabling vital processes such as replication and transcription.
