## The Problem it Addressed

At the time, the simple bacterial operon model was well-understood, but it couldn't explain how a single signal (like a hormone) could activate large sets of genes that were scattered across different chromosomes in a complex animal. The Britten-Davidson model proposed a hierarchical network to solve this problem.

## Key Components of the Model

The model proposed four main classes of sequences:

1. **Producer Genes:** These are the genes that encode for proteins, what we would now call structural or protein-coding genes.
    
2. **Receptor Sites:** These are regulatory DNA sequences (what we would now call enhancers or promoters) located next to a producer gene. A single producer gene could have several different receptor sites.
    
3. **Integrator Genes:** These genes were proposed to synthesize a mobile **"activator RNA"**. This activator RNA would then diffuse through the nucleus and bind to the receptor sites.
    
4. **Sensor Genes:** These genes would detect a signal (e.g., a hormone binding to a protein) and, in response, switch on their associated integrator genes.

## The Power of the Model: Combinatorial Control

The genius of the Britten-Davidson hypothesis was its **combinatorial logic**, which explained how complexity could arise from a limited number of components:

- **One-to-Many:** A single integrator gene could produce an activator RNA that controlled many different producer genes across the genome, as long as they all shared the same repetitive receptor site.
    
- **Many-to-One:** A single producer gene could be activated by different signals if it had multiple, different receptor sites, each recognized by a different activator RNA.
    
- **Gene Batteries:** A single sensor could activate a whole set of integrator genes, unleashing a cascade of activator RNAs that would coordinate the expression of a large, complex "battery" of producer genes.
    

## Its Legacy

While the model's specific mechanistic details have been updated, its core concepts were remarkably prescient:

- **What it got right:** It correctly predicted the fundamental logic of eukaryotic gene regulation: that diffusible **trans-acting** factors regulate genes by binding to specific **cis-acting** DNA sequences, and that complex patterns arise from **combinatorial control**.
    
- **What was updated:** We now know the diffusible "activator" is typically a **protein** (a transcription factor), not an RNA. Their "receptor sites" are what we now understand as **enhancers**, silencers, and other regulatory elements.
    

In summary, the Britten-Davidson model was the first to propose a plausible, systems-level network for gene regulation, and its conceptual framework correctly predicted the combinatorial logic that underlies all of modern developmental genetics.
