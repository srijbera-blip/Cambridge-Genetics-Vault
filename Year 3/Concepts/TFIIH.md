**TFIIH (Transcription Factor II H)** is a vital **general transcription factor (GTF)** required for the accurate initiation of transcription by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotes

.

Here's a detailed overview of TFIIH:

• **Role in Pre-initiation Complex (PIC) Assembly**: TFIIH is one of the later GTFs to enter the core transcription complex (pre-initiation complex) during its assembly at the promoter

.

• **Key Enzymatic Activities**: TFIIH possesses two critical enzymatic activities

:

    ◦ **Helicase Activity**: It contains **helicase activities** that are **ATP-dependent**

. These helicases are crucial for **promoter "opening" or "melting"**, unwinding the DNA to make the template strand accessible for transcription

.

    ◦ **Kinase Activity**: TFIIH also includes a **kinase activity**

. This kinase phosphorylates the **C-terminal domain (CTD)** of the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II. This phosphorylation is significant, as it is linked to RNA Polymerase II's processivity and couples transcription to other RNA processing events like splicing, poly-adenylation, and mRNA export. The CTD itself is a highly conserved repetitive region (52 repeats of YSPTSPS in humans) unique to eukaryotic Pol II

.

• **Role in DNA Repair**: Beyond transcription, TFIIH components are involved in **DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER)**

. NER is a DNA repair pathway that removes damaged bases and is **preferentially targeted to transcribed regions of the genome**, specifically to the **transcribed (template) strand**. This makes biological sense given its connection to active gene expression.
